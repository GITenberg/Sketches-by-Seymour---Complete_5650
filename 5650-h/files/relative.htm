        EBOOK EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION:<br /><br /> "Sketches by Seymour" was
        published in various versions about 1836. The copy used for this PG
        edition has no date and was published by Thomas Fry, London. Some of the
        90 plates note only Seymour's name, many are inscribed "Engravings by H.
        Wallis from sketches by Seymour." The printed book appears to be a
        compilation of five smaller volumes. From the confused chapter titles
        the reader may well suspect the printer mixed up the order of the
        chapters. The complete book in this digital edition is split into five
        smaller volumes&mdash;the individual volumes are of more manageable size
        than the 7mb complete version.<br /><br /> The importance of this
        collection is in the engravings. The text is often mundane, is full of
        conundrums and puns popular in the early 1800's&mdash;and is mercifully
        short. No author is given credit for the text though the section titled,
        "The Autobiography of Andrew Mullins" may give us at least his pen-name.<br /><br />

    <p>
      O! IZAAK WALTON!&mdash;Izaak Walton!&mdash;you have truly got me into a
      precious line, and I certainly deserve the rod for having, like a gudgeon,
      so greedily devoured the delusive bait, which you, so temptingly, threw
      out to catch the eye of my piscatorial inclination! I have read of right
      angles and obtuse angles, and, verily, begin to believe that there are
      also right anglers and obtuse anglers&mdash;and that I am really one of
      the latter class. But never more will I plant myself, like a weeping
      willow, upon the sedgy bank of stream or river. No!&mdash;on no account
      will I draw upon these banks again, with the melancholy prospect of no
      effects! The most 'capital place' will never tempt me to 'fish' again!
    </p>
    <p>
      My best hat is gone: not the 'way of all beavers'&mdash;into the water&mdash;but
      to cover the cranium of the owner of this wretched 'tile;' and in vain
      shall I seek it; for 'this' and 'that' are now certainly as far as the
      'poles' asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      My pockets, too, are picked! Yes&mdash;some clever 'artist' has drawn me
      while asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      My boots are filled with water, and my soles and heels are anything but
      lively or delighted. Never more will I impale ye, Gentles! on the word of
      a gentleman!&mdash;Henceforth, O! Hooks! I will be as dead to your
      attractions as if I were 'off the hooks!' and, in opposition to the maxim
      of Solomon, I will 'spare the rod.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of a basket of fish, lo! here's a pretty kettle of fish for the
      entertainment of my expectant friends&mdash;and sha'n't I be baited? as
      the hook said to the anger: and won't the club get up a Ballad on the
      occasion, and I, who have caught nothing, shall probably be made the
      subject of a 'catch!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Slush! slush!&mdash;Squash! squash!
    </p>
    <p>
      O! for a clean pair of stockings!&mdash;But, alack, what a tantalizing
      situation I am in!&mdash;There are osiers enough in the vicinity, but no
      hose to be had for love or money! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Two youths&mdash;and two guns appeared at early dawn in the suburbs. The
      youths were loaded with shooting paraphernalia and provisions, and their
      guns with the best Dartford gunpowder&mdash;they were also well primed for
      sport&mdash;and as polished as their gunbarrels, and both could boast a
      good 'stock' of impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely I heard the notes of a bird," cried one, looking up and down the
      street; "there it is again, by jingo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lark, I declare," asserted his brother sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lark or canary, it will be a lark if we can bring it down," replied his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yonder it is, in that ere cage agin the wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a shame!" exclaimed the philanthropic youth,&mdash;"to imprison a
      warbler of the woodlands in a cage, is the very height of cruelty&mdash;liberty
      is the birthright of every Briton, and British bird! I would rather be
      shot than be confined all my life in such a narrow prison. What a mockery
      too is that piece of green turf, no bigger than a slop-basin. How it must
      aggravate the feelings of one accustomed to range the meadows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miserable! I was once in a cage myself," said his chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did they take you for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me for?&mdash;for a 'lark.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty Dickey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I assure you, it was all 'dickey' with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you sing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I? yes, i' faith I sang pretty small the next morning when they
      fined me, and let me out. An idea strikes me Suppose you climb up that
      post, and let out this poor bird, ey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as you let him off, I'll let off my gun, and we'll see whether I
      can't 'bang' him in the race."
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done: the post was quickly climbed&mdash;the door of
      the cage was thrown open, and the poor bird in an attempt at 'death or

      Bang went the piece, and as soon as the curling smoke was dissipated, they
      sought for their prize, but in vain; the piece was discharged so close to
      the lark, that it was blown to atoms, and the feathers strewed the
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bolt!" cried the freedom-giving youth, "or we shall have to pay for the
      lark."

      and a portion of the dissipated 'lark,'&mdash;"for look, if here ain't the&mdash;bill,
      never trust me." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      WHAT a thrill of pleasure pervades the philanthropic breast on beholding
      the rapid march of Intellect! The lamp-lighter, but an insignificant
      'link' in the vast chain of society, has now a chance of shining at the
      Mechanics', and may probably be the means of illuminating a whole parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Literature has become the favourite pursuit of all classes, and the
      postman is probably the only man who leaves letters for the vulgar pursuit
      of lucre! Even the vanity of servant-maids has undergone a change&mdash;they
      now study 'Cocker' and neglect their 'figures.'

    <p>
      But the dustman may be said, 'par excellence,' to bear&mdash;the bell!

    <p>
      In the retired nook of an obscure coffee-shop may frequently be observed a
      pair of these interesting individuals sipping their mocha, newspaper in
      hand, as fixed upon a column&mdash;as the statue of Napoleon in the Place
      Vendome, and watching the progress of the parliamentary bills, with as
      much interest as the farmer does the crows in his corn-field!
    </p>
    <p>
      They talk of 'Peel,' and 'Hume,' and 'Stanley,' and bandy about their
      names as familiarly as if they were their particular acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a dust the Irish Member kicked up in the House last night," remarks
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His speech was a heap o' rubbish," replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I've no doubt was all contracted for! For my part I was once a
      Reformer&mdash;but Rads and Whigs is so low, that I've turned
      Conservative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so am I, for my Sal says as how it's so genteel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them other chaps after all on'y wants to throw dust in our eyes! But it's

      IT is the proud boast of some men that they have 'got a wrinkle.' How
      elated then ought this individual to be who has got so many! and yet,
      judging from the fretful expression of his physiognomy, one would suppose
      that he is by no means in 'fit' of good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      His industrious rib, however, appears quite delighted with her handiwork,
      and in no humour to find the least fault with the loose habits of her
      husband. He certainly looks angry, as a man naturally will when his
      'collar' is up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, on the other hand, preserves her equanimity in spite of his
      unexpected frowns, knowing from experience that those who sow do not
      always reap; and she has reason to be gratified, for every beholder will
      agree in her firm opinion, that even that inimitable ninth of ninths&mdash;Stulz,
      never made such a coat!
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of economy, we must allow some objections may be made to the
      extravagant waist, while the cuffs she has bestowed on him may probably be
      a fair return (with interest) of buffets formerly received.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tail (in two parts) is really as amusing as any 'tale' that ever
      emanated from a female hand. There is a moral melancholy about it that is
      inexpressibly interesting, like two lovers intended for each other, and
      that some untoward circumstance has separated; they are 'parted,' and yet
      are still 'attached,' and it is evident that one seems 'too long' for the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'goose' generally finishes the labours of the tailor. Now, some
      carping critics may be wicked enough to insinuate that this garb too was
      finished by a goose! The worst fate I can wish to such malignant scoffers
      is a complete dressing from this worthy dame; and if she does not make the
      wisest of them look ridiculous, then, and not till then, will I abjure my
      faith in her art of cutting!
    </p>
    <p>
      And proud ought that man to be of such a wife; for never was mortal
      'suited' so before! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      WHAT a type of true philosophy and courage is this Waltonian!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cool and unmoved he receives the sharp blows of the blustering wind&mdash;as
      if he were playing dummy to an experienced pugilist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although he would undoubtedly prefer the blast with the chill off, he is
      so warm an enthusiast, in the pursuit of his sport, that he looks with
      contempt upon the rude and vulgar sport of the elements. He really angles
      for love&mdash;and love alone&mdash;and limbs and body are literally
      transformed to a series of angles!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bent and sharp as his own hook, he watches his smooth float in the rough,
      but finds, alas! that it dances to no tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time and bait are both lost in the vain attempt: patiently he rebaits,
      until he finds the rebait brings his box of gentles to a discount; and
      then, in no gentle humour, with a baitless hook, and abated ardor, he
      winds up his line and his day's amusement(?)&mdash;and departs, with the
      determination of trying fortune (who has tried him) on some, future and
      more propitious day. Probably, on the next occasion, he may be gratified
      with the sight of, at least, one gudgeon, should the surface of the river
      prove glassy smooth and mirror-like. (We are sure his self-love will not
      be offended at the reflection!) and even now he may, with truth, aver,
      that although he caught nothing, he, at least, took the best perch in the
      undulating stream! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      dialogue, the young 'ooman gave a sudden lurch to larboard, and turned the
      boat completely over. The boatman, blowing like a porpoise, soon strode
      across the upturned bark, and turning round, beheld the drenched "fare"

                            Selected a seat
                On the branch of a wide-spreading tree,

                         There he silently sat,
            Watching his float&mdash;like a tortoise-shell cat,

                           Untiling his roof!
                       But he cared not for that,
              For it happened to be a superb water proof,
                        Which not being himself,
                             The poor elf!

                   As if a respect it would show it,
                         Tho' so much below it!
                  No presence of mind he dissembled,
                But as the branch shook so he trembled,
                  And the case was no longer a riddle
                                Or joke;
                   For the branch snapp'd and broke;
                               And altho'
                     The angler cried "Its no go!"

    <p>
      (Tower Street, 31st August, 18__)
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Chum,
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs has give me a whole holiday, and it's my intention to take the field
      to-morrow&mdash;and if so be you can come over your governor, and cut the
      apron and sleeves for a day&mdash;why
    </p>
    <p>
      "Together we will range the fields;"
    </p>
    <p>
      and if we don't have some prime sport, my name's not Dick, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've bought powder and shot, and my cousin which is Shopman to my Uncle at
      the corner, have lent me a couple of guns that has been 'popp'd.' Don't
      mind the expense, for I've shot enough for both. Let me know by Jim if you
      can cut your stick as early as nine, as I mean to have a lift by the
      Highgate what starts from the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind, I won't take no refusal&mdash;so pitch it strong to the old 'un, and
      carry your resolution nem. con.
    </p>
    <p>
      And believe me to be, your old Crony,
    </p>
    <p>
      RICHARD GRUBB.
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S. The guns hasn't got them thingummy 'caps,' but that's no matter, for
      cousin says them cocks won't always fight: while them as he has lent is
      reg'lar good&mdash;and never misses fire nor fires amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this elegant epistle, Mr. Richard Grubb was favoured with a
      line from Mr. Augustus Spriggs, expressive of his unbounded delight in
      having prevailed upon his governor to 'let him out;' and concluding with a
      promise of meeting the coach at Moorgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed hour, Mr. Richard Grubb, 'armed at all points,' mounted
      the stage&mdash;his hat cocked knowingly over his right eye&mdash;his gun
      half-cocked and slung over his shoulder, and a real penny Cuba in his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine mornin' for sport," remarked Mr. Richard Grubb to his
      fellow-passenger, a stout gentleman between fifty and sixty years of age,
      with a choleric physiognomy and a fierce-looking pigtail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dessay&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you hang out at Highgate?" continued the sportsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, are you a hinhabitant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there any birds thereabouts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty o' geese," sharply replied the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! werry good!&mdash;but I means game;&mdash;partridges and them
      sort o' birds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never see any except what I've brought down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I on'y vish I may bring down all I see, that's all," chuckled the joyous
      Mr. Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't at all like that 'ere gun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lor! bless you, how timorsome you are, 'tain't loaded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loaded or not loaded, it's werry unpleasant to ride with that gun o'
      yours looking into one's ear so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, don't be afeard, I'll twist it over t'other shoulder,&mdash;there!
      but a gun ain't a coach, you know, vich goes off whether it's loaded or
      not. Hollo! Spriggs! here you are, my boy, lord! how you are figg'd out&mdash;didn't
      know you&mdash;jump up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vere's my instrument o' destruction?" enquired the lively Augustus, when
      he had succeeded in mounting to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stow'd him in the boot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman mounted and drove off; the sportsmen chatting and laughing as
      they passed through 'merry Islington.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Von't ve keep the game alive!" exclaimed Spriggs, slapping his friend
      upon the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dessay you will," remarked the caustic old boy with the pigtail; "for
      it's little you'll kill, young gentlemen, and that's my belief!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On'y let's put 'em up, and see if we don't knock 'em down, as cleverly as
      Mister Robins does his lots," replied Spriggs, laughing at his own wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Highgate, the old gentleman, with a step-fatherly anxiety, bade
      them take care of the 'spring-guns' in their perambulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thankee, old boy," said Spriggs, "but we ain't so green as not to know
      that spring guns, like spring radishes, go off long afore Autumn, you
      know!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "Now let's load and prime&mdash;and make ready," said Mr. Richard, when
      they had entered an extensive meadow, "and&mdash;I say&mdash;vot are you
      about? Don't put the shot in afore the powder, you gaby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having charged, they shouldered their pieces and waded through the tall
      grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! crikey!&mdash;there's a heap o' birds," exclaimed Spriggs, looking up
      at a flight of alarmed sparrows. "Shall I bring 'em down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I vish you could! I'd have a shot at 'em," replied Mr. Grubb, "but
      they're too high for us, as the alderman said ven they brought him a
      couple o' partridges vot had been kept overlong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My eye! if there ain't a summat a moving in that 'ere grass yonder&mdash;cock
      your eye!" "Cock your gun&mdash;and be quiet," said Mr. Grubb. The anxiety
      of the two sportsmen was immense. "It's an hare&mdash;depend on't&mdash;stoop
      down&mdash;pint your gun,&mdash;and when I say fire&mdash;fire! there it
      is&mdash;fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang! bang! went the two guns, and a piercing squeak followed the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve've tickled him," exclaimed Spriggs, as they ran to pick up the spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve've pickled him, rayther," cried Grubbs, "for by gosh it's a piggy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo! you chaps, vot are you arter?" inquired a man, popping his head
      over the intervening hedge. "Vy, I'm blessed if you ain't shot von o'
      Stubbs's pigs." And leaping the hedge he took the 'pork' in his arms,
      while the sportsmen who had used their arms so destructively now took to
      their legs for security. But ignorance of the locality led them into the
      midst of a village, and the stentorian shouts of the pig-bearer soon
      bringing a multitude at their heels, Mr. Richard Grubb was arrested in his
      flight. Seized fast by the collar, in the grasp of the butcher and
      constable of the place, all escape was vain. Spriggs kept a respectful
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now my fine fellow," cried he, brandishing his staff, "you 'ither pays
      for that 'ere pig, or ve'll fix you in the cage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the said cage not being a bird-cage, Mr. Richard Grubb could see no
      prospect of sport in it, and therefore fearfully demanded the price of the
      sucking innocent, declaring his readiness to 'shell out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stubbs, the owner, stepped forward, and valued it at eighteen
      shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot! eighteen shillings for that 'ere little pig!" exclaimed the
      astounded sportsman. "Vy I could buy it in town for seven any day."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Stubbs was obdurate, and declared that he would not 'bate a
      farden,' and seeing no remedy, Mr. Richard Grubb was compelled to 'melt a
      sovereign,' complaining loudly of the difference between country-fed and
      town pork!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouldering his gun, he joined his companion in arms, amid the jibes and
      jeers of the grinning rustics.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, I'm blowed if that ain't a cooler!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, ve've made a hit at any rate," said the consoling Spriggs,
      "and ve've tried our metal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's tried my metal preciously&mdash;changed a suv'rin to two bob!
      by jingo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's turn Jews," said Spriggs, "and make a vow never to touch pork
      again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot's the use o' that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, we shall save our bacon in future, to be sure," replied Spriggs,
      laughing, and Grubb joining in his merriment, they began to look about
      them, not for fresh pork, but for fresh game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more shooting in the grass, mind!" said Grubb, "or ve shall have the
      blades upon us agin for another grunter p'r'aps. Our next haim must be at
      birds on the ving! No more forking out. Shooting a pig ain't no lark&mdash;that's
      poz!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "Twig them trees?"&mdash;said Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prime!" exclaimed Spriggs, "and vith their leaves ve'll have an hunt
      there.&mdash;Don't you hear the birds a crying 'sveet,' 'sveet?' Thof all
      birds belong to the Temperance Society by natur', everybody knows as
      they're partic'larly fond of a little s'rub!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think ve could leap the ditch?" said Mr. Richard, regarding with a
      longing look the tall trees and the thick underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lauk! I'll over it in a jiffy," replied the elastic Mr. Spriggs there
      ain't no obelisk a sportsman can't overcome"&mdash;and no sooner had he
      uttered these encouraging words, than he made a spring, and came
      'close-legged' upon the opposite bank; unfortunately, however, he lost his
      balance, and fell plump upon a huge stinging nettle, which would have been
      a treat to any donkey in the kingdom!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!&mdash;cuss the thing!" shrieked Mr. Spriggs, losing his equanimity
      with his equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be in a passion, Spriggs," said Grubb, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me in a passion?&mdash;I'm not in a passion&mdash;I'm on'y&mdash;on'y&mdash;nettled!"
      replied he, recovering his legs and his good humour. Mr. Grubb, taking
      warning by his friend's slip, cautiously looked out for a narrower part of
      the ditch, and executed the saltatory transit with all the agility of a
      poodle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon penetrated the thicket, and a bird hopped so near them, that
      they could not avoid hitting it.&mdash;Grubb fired, and Sprigg's gun
      echoed the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve've done him!" cried Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve!&mdash;me, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell&mdash;no matter," replied his chum, "you shot a bird, and I shot
      too!&mdash;Vot's that?&mdash;my heye, I hear a voice a hollering like
      winkin; bolt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Away scampered Spriggs, and off ran Grubb, never stopping till he reached
      a high paling, which, hastily climbing, he found himself literally upon
      tenter-hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a man a coming, old fellow," said an urchin, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man coming! vich vay? do tell me vich vay?" supplicated the sportsman.
      The little rogue, however, only stuck his thumb against his snub nose&mdash;winked,
      and ran off.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Grubb was not long held in suspense; a volley of inelegant phrases
      saluted his ears, while the thong of a hunting-whip twisted playfully
      about his leg. Finding the play unequal, he wisely gave up the game&mdash;by
      dropping his bird on one side, and himself on the other; at the same time
      reluctantly leaving a portion of his nether garment behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are!" cried his affectionate friend,&mdash;picking him up&mdash;"ain't
      you cotch'd it finely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't I, that's all?" said the almost breathless Mr. Grubb, "I'm almost
      dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!&mdash;nonsense&mdash;to be sure, you may say as how you're off the
      hooks! and precious glad you ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious me! Spriggs, don't joke; it might ha' bin werry serious," said
      Mr. Grubb, with a most melancholy shake of the head:&mdash;"Do let's get
      out o' this wile place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, vat the dickins!" exclaimed Spriggs, "you ain't sewed up yet, are
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Grubb, forcing a smile in spite of himself, "I vish I vos,
      Spriggs; for I 've got a terrible rent here!" delicately indicating the
      position of the fracture.
    </p>
    <p>
      And hereupon the two friends resolving to make no further attempt at
      bush-ranging, made as precipitate a retreat as the tangled nature of the
      preserve permitted. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      into a pickle," said Sprigg, still chuckling over their last adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" cried Grubb, laying his hand upon his arm&mdash;"see that bird
      hopping there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve'll soon make him hop the twig, and no mistake," remarked Spriggs.
    </p>

      "There he goes into the 'edge to get his dinner, I s'pose."

    <p>
      "Looking for a 'edge-stake, I dare say," said the facetious Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for it!" cried Grubb! "pitch into him!" and drawing his trigger he
      accidentally knocked off the bird, while Spriggs discharged the contents
      of his gun through the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hit summat at last!" exclaimed the delighted Grubb, scampering towards
      the thorny barrier, and clambering up, he peeped into an adjoining garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have the goodness to hand me that little bird I've just shot off
      your 'edge," said he to a gardener, who was leaning on his spade and
      holding his right leg in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You fool," cried the horticulturist, "you've done a precious job&mdash;
      You've shot me right in the leg&mdash;O dear! O dear! how it pains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm werry sorry&mdash;take the bird for your pains," replied Grubb, and
      apprehending another pig in a poke, he bobbed down and retreated as fast
      as his legs could carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot's frightened you?" demanded Spriggs, trotting off beside his chum,
      "You ain't done nothing, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On'y shot a man, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true&mdash;and there'll be the devil to pay if ve're cotched, I can
      tell you&mdash;'Vy the gardener vill swear as it's a reg'lar plant!&mdash;and
      there von't be no damages at all, if so be he says he can't do no work,
      and is obleeged to keep his bed&mdash;so mizzle!" With the imaginary
      noises of a hot pursuit at their heels, they leaped hedge, ditch, and
      style without daring to cast a look behind them&mdash;and it was not until
      they had put two good miles of cultivated land between them and the spot
      of their unfortunate exploit that they ventured to wheel about and breathe
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, if this 'ere ain't a rum go!"&mdash;said Spriggs&mdash;"in four
      shots&mdash;ve've killed a pig&mdash;knocked the life out o' one
      dicky-bird&mdash;and put a whole charge into a calf. Vy, if ve go on at
      this rate we shall certainly be taken up and get a setting down in the
      twinkling of a bed-post!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See if I haim at any think agin but vot's sitting on a rail or a post"&mdash;said
      Mr. Richard&mdash;"or s'pose Spriggs you goes on von side of an 'edge and
      me on t'other&mdash;and ve'll get the game between us&mdash;and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thankye for me, Dick," interrupted Spriggs, "but that'll be a sort o'
      cross-fire that I sha'n't relish no how.&mdash;Vy it'll be just for all
      the world like fighting a jewel&mdash;on'y ve shall exchange shots&mdash;p'r'aps
      vithout any manner o' satisfaction to 'ither on' us. No&mdash;no&mdash;let's
      shoot beside von another&mdash;for if ve're beside ourselves ve may commit
      suicide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My vig!" cries Mr. Grubb, "there's a covey on 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charge 'em, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! fust charge our pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having performed this preliminary act, the sportsmen crouched in a dry
      ditch and crawled stealthily along in order to approach the tempting covey
      as near as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up flew the birds, and with trembling hands they simultaneously touched
      the triggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve've nicked some on 'em."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead as nits," said Spriggs.

    <p>
      "Don't be in an hurry now," said the cautious Mr. Grubb, "ve don't know
      for certain yet, vot ve hav'n't hit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be nothin' but a balloon then," replied Spriggs, "for ve on'y
      fired in the hair I'll take my 'davy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the right and the left and observing nothing, they boldly
      advanced in order to appropriate the spoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's feathers at any rate," said Spriggs, "ve've blown him to shivers,
      by jingo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here's a bird! hooray!" cried the delighted Grubb&mdash;"and look'ee,
      here's another&mdash;two whole 'uns&mdash;and all them remnants going for
      nothing as the linen-drapers has it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot are they, Dick?" inquired Spriggs, whose ornithological knowledge was
      limited to domestic poultry; "sich voppers ain't robins or sparrers, I
      take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy!" said the dubious Mr. Richard-resting on his gun and throwing one leg
      negligently over the other&mdash;"I do think they're plovers, or larks, or
      summat of that kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot's in a name; the thing ve call a duck by any other name vould heat as
      vell!" declaimed Spriggs, parodying the immortal Shakspeare.
    </p>

    <p>
      TYING the legs of the birds together with a piece of string, Spriggs
      proudly carried them along, dangling at his fingers' ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tramping for a long mile, the friends at length discovered, what
      they termed, an house of "hentertainment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering a parlour, with a clean, sanded floor, (prettily herring-boned,
      as the housemaids technically phrase it,) furnished with red curtains,
      half a dozen beech chairs, three cast-iron spittoons, and a beer-bleached
      mahogany table,&mdash;Spriggs tugged at the bell. The host, with a rotund,
      smiling face, his nose, like Bardolph's, blazing with fiery meteors, and a
      short, white apron, concealing his unmentionables, quickly answered the
      tintinabulary summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Landlord," said Spriggs, who had seated himself in a chair, while Mr.
      Richard was adjusting his starched collar at the window;&mdash;"Landlord!
      ve should like to have this 'ere game dressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Landlord eyed the 'game' through his spectacles, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roasted, or biled, Sir?" demanded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Biled?&mdash;no:&mdash;roasted, to be sure!" replied Spriggs, amazed at
      his pretended obtuseness: "and, I say, landlord, you can let us have
      plenty o' nice wedgetables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greens?" said the host;&mdash;but whether alluding to the verdant
      character of his guests, or merely making a polite inquiry as to the
      article they desired, it was impossible, from his tone and manner, to
      divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greens!" echoed Spriggs, indignantly; "no:&mdash;peas and 'taters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Directly, Sir," replied the landlord; and taking charge of the two leetle
      birds, he departed, to prepare them for the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot a rum cove that 'ere is," said Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Double stout, eh?" said Spriggs, and then they both fell to a-laughing;
      "and certain it is, that, although the artist has only given us a draught
      of the landlord, he was a subject sufficient for a butt!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell! I must, say," said Grubb, stretching his weary legs under the
      mahogany, "I never did spend sich a pleasant day afore&mdash;never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," chimed in Spriggs, "and many a day ven I'm a chopping up the
      'lump' shall I think on it. It's ralely bin a hout and houter! Lauk! how
      Suke vill open her heyes, to be sure, ven I inform her how ve've bin out
      with two real guns, and kill'd our own dinner. I'm bless'd if she'll
      swallow it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must say ve have seen a little life," said Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And death too," added Spriggs. "Vitness the pig!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now don't!" remonstrated Grubb, who was rather sore upon this part of the
      morning's adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the gardener,"&mdash;persisted Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush for goodness sake!" said Mr. Richard, very seriously, "for if that
      'ere affair gets vind, ve shall be blown, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;In came the dinner. The display was admirable and very abundant,
      and the keen air, added to the unusual exercise of the morning, had given
      the young gentlemen a most voracious appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds were particularly sweet, but afforded little more than a
      mouthful to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'wedgetables,' however, with a due proportion of fine old Cheshire,
      and bread at discretion, filled up the gaps. It was only marvellous where
      two such slender striplings could find room to stow away such an alarming
      quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      How calm and pleasant was the 'dozy feel' that followed upon mastication,
      as they opened their chests (and, if there ever was a necessity for such
      an action, it was upon this occasion,) and lolling back in their chairs,
      sipped the 'genuine malt and hops,' and picked their teeth!
    </p>
    <p>
      The talkative Spriggs became taciturn. His gallantry, however, did prompt
      him, upon the production of a 'fresh pot,' to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, Grubbs, my boy, here's the gals!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gals!" languidly echoed Mr. Richard, tossing off his tumbler, with a
      most appropriate smack. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "PULL the bell, Spriggs," said Mr. Richard, "and let's have the bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Augustus Spriggs obeyed, and the landlord appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot's to pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send you the bill directly, gentlemen," replied the landlord, bowing, and
      trundling out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook presently entered, and laying the bill at Mr. Grubb's elbow, took
      off the remnants of the 'game,' and left the sportsmen to discuss the
      little account.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My eye! if this ain't a rum un!" exclaimed Grubb, casting his dilating
      oculars over the slip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, vot's the damage?" enquired Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten and fourpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten and fourpence!&mdash;never!" cried his incredulous companion. "Vot a
      himposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell!" said Mr. Grubb, with a bitter emphasis, "if this is finding our
      own wittles, we'll dine at the hor'nary next time"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have a squint at it," said Mr. Spriggs, reaching across the table;
      but all his squinting made the bill no less, and he laid it down with a
      sigh. "It is coming it rayther strong, to be sure," continued he; "but I
      dare say it's all our happearance has as done it. He takes us for people
      o' consequence, and"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot consequence is that to us?" said Grubbs, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, never mind, Dick, it's on'y vonce a-year, as the grotto-boys says&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It need'nt to be; or I'll be shot if he mightn't vistle for the brads.
      Howsomever, there's a hole in another suv'rin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ve shall get through it the sooner," replied the consoling Spriggs. "I
      see, Grubb, there aint a bit of the Frenchman about you"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cos, you know, they're fond o' changing their suv'rins, and&mdash;you
      aint!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasant humour of Spriggs soon infected Grubb, and he resolved to be
      jolly, and keep up the fun, in spite of the exorbitant charge for the
      vegetable addenda to their supply of game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, don't look at the bill no more," advised Spriggs, "but treat it as
      old Villiams does his servants ven they displeases him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, discharge it, to be sure," replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sage advice being promptly followed, the sportsmen, shouldering their
      guns, departed in quest of amusement. They had not, however, proceeded far
      on their way, before a heavy shower compelled them to take shelter under a
      hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Werry pleasant!" remarked Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your powder dry," said Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me alone," replied Spriggs; "and I think as we'd better pop our
      guns under our coat-tails too, for these ere cocks aint vater-cocks, you
      know! Vell, I never seed sich a rain. I'm bless'd if it vont drive all the
      dickey-birds to their nestes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I vish I'd brought a numberella," said Grubbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lank! vot a pretty fellow you are for a sportsman!" said Spriggs, "it
      don't damp my hardour in the least. All veathers comes alike to me, as the
      butcher said ven he vos a slaughtering the sheep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Grubb, here joined in the laugh of his good-humoured friend,
      whose unwearied tongue kept him in spirits&mdash;rather mixed indeed than
      neat&mdash;for the rain now poured down in a perfect torrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Dick," said Spriggs, "vy are ve two like razors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cos ve're good-tempered?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "A hexcellent conundrum," exclaimed Grubb. "Vere do you get 'em?'

      A blustering wind arose, and like a burly coachman on mounting his box,
      took up the rain!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two crouching friends taking advantage of the cessation in the storm,
      prepared to start. But in straightening the acute angles of their legs and
      arms, Mr. Sprigg's piece, by some entanglement in his protecting garb,
      went off, and the barrel striking Mr. Grubb upon the os nasi, stretched
      him bawling on the humid turf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! Lord! I'm shot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! my heye!" exclaimed the trembling Spriggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! my nose!" roared Grubb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no go!&mdash;I'm a dead man!" blubbered Mr. Richard. Mr. Augustus
      Spriggs now raised his chum upon his legs, and was certainly rather
      alarmed at the sanguinary effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vere's your hankercher?&mdash;here!&mdash;take mine,&mdash;that's it&mdash;there!&mdash;let's
      look at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you see it?" said Grubb, mournfully twisting about his face most
      ludicrously, and trying at the same time to level his optics towards the
      damaged gnomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't feel it," said Grubb; "it's numbed like dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My gun vent off quite by haccident, and if your nose is spoilt, can't you
      have a vax von?&mdash;Come, it ain't so bad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vax von, indeed!&mdash;who vouldn't rather have his own nose than all
      the vax vons in the vorld?" replied poor Richard. "I shall never be able
      to show my face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy not?&mdash;your face ain't touched, it's on'y your nose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, if I come out agin in an hurry," continued the wounded sportsman.
      "I've paid precious dear for a day's fun. The birds vill die a nat'ral
      death for me, I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It vos a terrible blow&mdash;certainly," said Spriggs; "but these things
      vill happen in the best riggle'ated families!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can that be? there's no piece, in no quiet and respectable families
      as I ever seed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this very paradoxical dictum, Mr. Grubb trudged on, leading
      himself by the nose; Spriggs exerting all his eloquence to make him think
      lightly of what Grubb considered such a heavy affliction; for after all,
      although he had received a terrible contusion, there were no bones broken:
      of which Spriggs assured his friend and himself with a great deal of
      feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the shades of evening concealed them from the too scrutinizing
      observation of the passengers they encountered on their return, for such
      accidents generally excite more ridicule than commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spriggs having volunteered his services, saw Grubb safe home to his door
      in Tower Street, and placing the two guns in his hands, bade him a cordial
      farewell, promising to call and see after his nose on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following parody of a customary paragraph in the papers will be
      considered, we think, a most fitting conclusion to their day's sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In consequence of a letter addressed to Mr. Augustus Spriggs, by Mr.
      Richard Grubb, the parties met early yesterday morning, but after firing
      several shots, we are sorry to state that they parted without coming to

      How beautiful is the simplicity of unsophisticated youth! Behold with what
      patience this innocent awaits a bite, trusting with perfect faith in the
      truth of his affectionate mother's ichthyological knowledge. Wishing to
      behold a live fish dangling at the end of his line, he has, with admirable
      foresight, drawn up the bucket, that in the ascent the finny prey may not
      kick it! It must be a hard roe indeed, that is not softened by his
      attentions; but, alas! he is doomed never to draw up a vulgar herring, or
      a well-bred fish!
    </p>
    <p>
      Folks who are a little deeper read than the boy&mdash;(or the herring!)&mdash;may
      smile at his fruitless attempt, but how many are there that act through
      life upon the same principle, casting their lines and fishing for&mdash;compliments,
      who never obtain even a nibble&mdash;for why? their attempts at applause,
      like his red-herring, are smoked. He does not know that herrings are
      salt-water fish&mdash;and, in fact, that the well-water is not the roes&mdash;water!
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, is not such ignorance bliss?&mdash;for he enjoys the
      anticipated pleasure; and if anticipation be really greater than reality&mdash;what
      an interminable length will that pleasure be to him! Ever and anon he
      draws up his line, like a militia captain for a review;&mdash;puts fresh
      bait on the crooked pin, and lets it slowly down, and peeps in, wondering
      what the fish can be at!&mdash;and is quite as much in the dark as his
      float. But he may at last, perhaps, discover that he is not so deep as a
      well&mdash;and wisely resolve to let well&mdash;alone; two points which
      may probably be of infinite importance to him through life, and enable him
      to turn the laugh against those who now mock his ignorance and simplicity.

      "O! Molly! Molly! ven I popp'd my chops through the arey railings, and
      seed you smile, I thought you vos mine for ever! I wentur'd all for you&mdash;all&mdash;.
      It war'n't no great stake p'r'aps, but it was a tender vun! I offer'd you
      a heart verbally, and you said 'No!' I writ this ere wollentine, and you
      returns it vith a big 'No!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! Molly your 'No's,' is more piercinger and crueller than your heyes.
      Me! to be used so:&mdash;Me! as refused the vidder at the Coal Shed! (to
      be sure she wore a vig and I didn't vant a bald rib!) Me!&mdash;but it's

      "It'll be too late then, Molly, ven you've led me to the halter, to vish
      as you'd married me."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this bitter burst of wounded feeling, and, urged by the rejection of
      his addresses, the love-lorn Butcher mounted a joint-stool, and stepping
      on a fence, twisted the awful rope round the branch of a tree, and then,
      coiling it about his neck, determined that this day should be a killing
      day; vainly supposing, in the disordered state of his mind, that the
      flinty-hearted Molly would probably esteem her 'dear' (like venison) the
      better for being hung! Mystically muttering 'adoo!' three times, in the
      most pathetic tone, he swung off and in an instant came to his latter end&mdash;for
      the rope snapp'd in twain, and he found himself seated on the turf below,
      when he vainly imagined he was preparing himself for being placed below
      the turf!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' but disappointments in this world;" exclaimed he, really feeling
      hurt by the unexpected fall, for he had grazed his calves in the meadow,
      and was wofully vexed at finding himself a lover 'turned off' and yet
      'unhung.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cast down and melancholy, he retraced his steps, and seizing a cleaver
      (dreadful weapon!) vented his suicidal humour in chopping, with malignant
      fury, at his own block! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "WHAT are you grinning at, boys?" angrily demanded an old gentleman seated

      behind a high paling at his rear.&mdash;"Don't you know a little makes
      fools laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir! that's quite true, for we were laughing at what you've caught!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Umph! I tell you what, my lads, if I knew your master, I'd pull you up,
      and have you well dressed."

      "Tell that to the fishes," replied the elder, "when you do get a bite!"

    </p>
    <p>

      said the younger.

    <p>
      "More than that," continued his companion. "We are above speaking to you,
      for you are beneath us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, rather nettled at the glibness of the lads, stuck a
      hook vengefully into an inoffensive worm, and threw his line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys still retained their post, and after many whispered remarks and
      tittering, the younger thrust his handkerchief into his mouth to smother a
      burst of irrepressible laughter, while the other, assuming a modest and
      penitent air, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" demanded the old gentleman sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope you are not offended, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get along with you," replied the unfortunate angler, irritated at his
      want of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you something, sir," continued the lad;&mdash;"there's no fish
      to be had where you are. I know the river well. Father's very fond o'
      fish; he always brings home plenty. If you like, sir, I can show you the
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his companion rolled upon the grass and kicked, perfectly convulsed
      with laughter, luckily hidden from the view of the now mollified old
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried the angler: "is it far from this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a quarter of a mile," replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is nothing. I've walked eighteen this morning," said the old
      gentleman, packing up his apparatus. "I'll go with you directly, and thank
      you too, for I'm a perfect stranger in these parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had joined them, the laughing fits of the younger had subsided,
      although he chose to fall in the rear. "Now, to shew you how much more
      profitable it is to respect than to mock at your superiors in years,
      there's a (let me see)&mdash;there's a halfpenny for you to purchase
      cakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank ye, sir," said he, and turning to his companion with a wink: "Here
      Bill, run to Cummins' and buy a ha'p'orth of eights&mdash;we'll make the
      most of it&mdash;and I'll come to you as soon as I've shown the gentleman
      the fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show me the place, and I'll find the fish," said the anticipating angler.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they trudged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must we go through the town?" asked his companion, as he marched with his
      long rod in one hand and his can in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, it ain't far;" and he walked on at a quicker pace, while all
      the crowd of rustics gazed at t e extraordinary appearance of the armed
      Waltonian, for it happened to be market-day. After parading him in this
      fashion nearly through the town, he presently twitched him by his
      coat-sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look there, sir!" cried he, pointing to a well-stocked fishmonger's.
    </p>

      "Beautiful!&mdash;what a quantity!" exclaimed the venerable piscator.

      JACK was an itinerant vender of greens, and his spouse was a peripatetic
      distributor of the finny tribe, (sprats, herrings or mackerel, according
      to the season,) and both picked up a tolerable livelihood by their
      respective callings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the lettuces he sold, Jack had a good heart, and his attention was
      first attracted to the subsequent object of his election by the wit of a
      passing boy, who asked the damsel how she sold her carrots? Jack's eyes
      were in an instant turned towards one whom he considered a competitor in
      the trade&mdash;when he beheld the physiognomy of his Sarah beaming with
      smiles beneath an abundant crop of sunny hair!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a beauty and no mistake," exclaimed the green grocer in
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flummery!" replied the damsel&mdash;the deep blush of modesty mantling
      her cheeks. Jack rested his basket on a post beside her stall, and drank
      deep draughts of love, while Sarah's delicate fingers were skilfully
      employed in undressing a pound of wriggling eels for a customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Them's rig'lar voppers!" remarked Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three to a pound," answered Sarah, and so they slipped naturally into
      discourse upon trade, its prospects and profits, and gradually a hint of
      partnership was thrown out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarah laughed at his insinuating address, and displayed a set of teeth
      that rivalled crimped skate in their whiteness&mdash;a month afterwards
      they became man and wife. For some years they toiled on together&mdash;he,
      like a caterpillar, getting a living out of cabbages, and she, like an
      undertaker, out of departed soles! Latterly, however, Jack discovered that
      his spouse was rather addicted to 'summut short,' in fact, that she drank
      like a fish, although the beverage she affected was a leetle stronger than
      water. Their profit (unlike Mahomet) permitted them the same baneful
      indulgence&mdash;and kept them both in spirits!
    </p>
    <p>
      Their trade, however, fell off for they were often unable to carry their
      baskets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last time we beheld them, Sarah was sitting in the cooling current of
      a gutter, with her heels upon the curb (alas! how much did she need a
      curb!) while Jack, having disposed of his basket, had obtained a post in a
      public situation, was holding forth on the impropriety of her conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you let yourself down so?" said he,&mdash;"You're drunk&mdash;drunk,
      Sarah, drunk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On'y a little elevated, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elevated!&mdash;floor'd you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell; vot's the odds as long as you're happy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack finding all remonstrance was vain, brought himself up, and reeling
      forward, went as straight home&mdash;as he could, leaving his spouse (like
      many a deserted wife) soaking her clay, because he refused to support her!

      makes him turn about and wheel about, like Jim Crow, in anything but a
      pleasant humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It were well if every wayfarer were like the sailor, who when offered a
      quid from the 'bacoo box of a smoker, said, 'I never chews the short-cut!'
      and in the same spirit, we strongly advise him, before he takes the
      short-cut to think of the returns!
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the weather prove rainy, the hungry traveller may certainly get a
      wet on the road, although he starves before he reaches the wished-for inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there is likewise no more chance of meeting a good tempered guide on a
      cross-road, than of finding eggs and bacon, in an edible state, at least
      on a common&mdash;and as he can no more pull in the summer-rains than he
      can the reins of a runaway stallion; the result is, the inexperienced
      youth ludicrously represents so many pounds of 'dripping,' and although he
      may be thirsty, he will have no cause to complain that he is&mdash;dry!
      The best mode for an honest man to go round the country, is to take a
      straight-forward course, especially when the surcharged clouds do rule the
      horizon with sloping lines of rain! Besides, it is by no means a pleasant
      thing for a man with a scanty wardrobe, to find his clothes running away
      at a most unpleasant rate, while he can scarcely drag one clay-encumbered
      leg after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a difficult trial, too, of a man's philosophy, after trudging over a
      long field, to be encountered by the mockery of a 'ha! ha!'&mdash;fence!
      He utters a few bitter expletives, perhaps, but nought avails his railing
      against such a fence as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      The shower which makes all nature smile, only causes him to laugh&mdash;on
      the wrong side of his mouth, for he regards it as a temperance man does a
      regular soaker!
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader! never attempt a bye-way on a wet day, with a stick and bundle at
      your back&mdash;(if you have a waterproof trunk, you may indeed weather
      it)&mdash;but go a-head on the turnpike road&mdash;the way of all mails&mdash;leaving
      long and short commons to the goose and donkey&mdash;and the probability
      is, that you may not only I make a sign before you die, but get a feed&mdash;and
      a shelter. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      IT is a most extraordinary thing, 'pon my veracity: I go out as regularly
      as the year, and yet I never bring down an individual bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have one of the best Mantons going with such a bore! and then I use the
      best shot&mdash;but not being the best shot in the world myself&mdash;I
      suppose is the identical reason why I never hit any thing. I think it must
      arise from a natural defect in my sight; for when I suppose a covey as
      near&mdash;as my miser of an uncle&mdash;they are probably as distant&mdash;as
      my ninety-ninth cousin!

      Such a rum go!&mdash;the other day I had a troop of fellows at my heels,
      laughing like mad; and what do you think?&mdash;when I doffed my shooting
      jacket, I found some wag had stuck the top of a printed placard on my
      back, with the horrid words, "A young Gentleman missing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only last week, a whole flight of sparrows rose at my very feet&mdash;I

      vulgar peasant took the trouble to leap his fence, and inform me I had
      broken his windows&mdash;of course I was compelled to pay him for his
      panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure he did rather indicate a disposition to take away my gun&mdash;which
      I certainly should never have relinquished without a struggle&mdash;and so
      I forked out the dibs, in order to keep the piece! I'm quite positive,
      however, that the vagabond over-charged me, and I kicked, as was quite
      natural, you know, under such circumstances!
    </p>
    <p>
      I really have an imperfect notion of disposing of my shooting-tackle&mdash;but

    <p>
      FROM
    </p>
    <p>
      SAMUEL SOFTLY, ESQ. TO HIS FRIEND, RICHARD GUBBINS, ESQ. OF TOOLEY STREET.
    </p>
    <p>
      O! DICK!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a misfortin' has you never heard on as come upon your friend. I'll
      jist give you a breef houtline of the circumstantials as near as my flurry
      vill let me. T'other mornin' I vips up my gun for to go a-shootin', and
      packin' up my hammunition, and some sanwidges, I bids adoo to this wile
      smoky town, vith the intention of gettin' a little hair. Vell! on I goes
      a-visshin' and thinkin' on nothin', and happy as the bumblebees as vos
      a-numming around me. Vell! a'ter an hour or more's valking, not an house
      nor a brick vos wisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natur', in all her werdur', vos smilin' like a fat babby in its maternal
      harms! But, as somebody has it&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man never ain't, but al'ays to be bless'd,"
    </p>
    <p>
      and I'm bless'd if that ain't true too, as you shall see presently. Vell!
      I pops at von bird and then at another; but vether the poor creturs vos
      unaccustom'd to guns, and so vos frighten'd, I don't know, but somehow I
      couldn't hit 'em no-how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vell! and so I vos jist a-chargin' agin ven a great he-fellow, in a ruff
      coat and partic'lar large viskers, accostes me (ciwilly I must say, but
      rayther familler)&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Birds shy?" says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Werry;&mdash;ain't hit nothin'," says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you vot it is, young gentleman," says he, "it's the unevenness
      o' the ground!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "D've think so?" says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure on it," says he; "I'm a hold sojer! Know this 'ere place, and have
      picked up many a good dinner in it. Look at them fe'l'fares yonder," says
      he, "on'y let me have a slap at 'em for you, and see if I don't finish
      some on 'em in the twinkling of a pig's visper."
    </p>
    <p>
      In course I felt obleeged by sich a hoffer, and hands him the gun. Vell! I
      vos a-follerin' him quite pleased, ven he visks round, and puttin' the
      muzzle o' the hinstrument fist agin my vescoat, says he, "Now you've lent
      us your gun, you may as vell lend us your votch. I can't shoot any think
      for you till I sees vot's o'clock!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here vas a go!&mdash;but I see vot vas a clock in a hinstant&mdash;and no
      mistake. So I cotch'd hold on the two butiful chased seals and tugs it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the time o' day!" says he, a-cockin' his hugly heye at the dial;
      "and now," says he, "as you seems frightened at the gun, I shall jist put
      it out o' harm's way."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that he chucks it splash, into a duck-pond, and hoff marches my
      hold sojer in a jiffy! I vos putrified! and fell to a-blubberin' like a
      hinfant.

    <p>
      AMONG the very few fashionable foibles to which Mr. Wiggins was addicted,
      was the smoking of cigars. Attracted by the appearance of a small box
      marked 'Marylands&mdash;one penny each,' very much resembling
      lettuce-leaves with the yellow jaundice, he walked into the chandler's
      shop where they were displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us look at them cigars," said he, and then, for the first time,
      glancing at the smart, good-looking mistress of the emporium, he added,
      "if you please, ma'am&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certain'y, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty little fist that, howsomever! thought Wiggins, as she placed the
      box before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vill you have a light?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank'ye, ma'am," said he, ramming the cigar into his mouth, as if he
      really intended to bolt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She twisted a slip of waste, and lighting it, presented it to her admiring
      customer, for it was evident, from the rapt manner in which he scanned
      her, that he was deeply smitten by her personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored, coughed delicately, as the smoke tickled the tonsils of her
      throat, and looked full at the youth. Such a look! as Wiggins asserted.
      "I'm afeared as the smoke is disagreeable," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! dear no, not at all, I assure you; I likes it of all things. I can't
      abide a pipe no-how, but I've quite a prevalence (predilection?) for
      siggers." So Wiggins puffed and chatted away; and at last, delighted with
      the sprightly conversation of the lady, seated himself on the small-beer
      barrel, and so far forgot his economy in the fascination of his
      entertainer, that he purchased a second. At this favourable juncture, Mrs.
      Warner, (for she was a widow acknowledging five-and-twenty) ordered the
      grinning shop-boy, who was chopping the 'lump,' to take home them 'ere
      dips to a customer who lived at some distance. Wiggins, not aware of the
      'ruse,' felt pleased with the absence of one who was certainly 'de trop'
      in the engrossing 'tete-a-tete.' We will pass over this preliminary
      conversation; for a whole week the same scene was renewed, and at last
      Mrs. Warner and Mr. Wiggins used to shake hands at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you hever go out?" said Wiggns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sildom-werry sildom," replied the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vos you never at the Vite Cundic, or the hEagle, or any of them places on
      a Sunday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I go," replied the widow, sighing, "vithout a purtector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon the enamoured Wiggins said, "How happy he should be," etc., and
      the widow said, "She was sure for her part," etc. and so the affair was
      settled. On the following Sunday the gallant Mr. Wiggins figged out, in
      his best, escorted the delighted and delightful Mrs. Warner to that place
      of fashionable resort, the White Conduit, and did the thing so handsomely,
      that the lady was quite charmed. Seated in one of the snug arbors of that
      suburban establishment, she poured out the hot tea, and the swain the most
      burning vows of attachment. "Mr. Viggins, do you take sugar?" demanded the
      fair widow. "Yes, my haingel," answered he, emphatically. "I loves all
      wot's sweet," and then he gave her such a tender squeeze! "Done&mdash;do&mdash;you
      naughty man!" cried she, tapping him on the knuckles with the plated
      sugar-tongs, and then cast down her eyes with such a roguish modesty, that
      he repeated the operation for the sake of that ravishing expression.
      Pointing his knife at a pat of butter, he poetically exclaimed, "My heart
      is jist like that&mdash;and you have made a himpression on it as time will
      never put out!" "I did'nt think as you were quite so soft neither," said
      the widow. "I ham," replied the suitor&mdash;"and there," continued he,
      cutting a hot roll, and introducing the pat, "I melts as easily afore the
      glance of your beautiful heyes!" Resolved to carry on the campaign with
      spirit, he called for two glasses of brandy and water, stiff, and three
      cigars! And now, becoming sentimental and communicative, he declared, with
      his hand upon his heart, that "hif there vos a single thing in life as
      would make him completely happy, it vos a vife!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Mr. Wiggins was so intoxicated with love, brandy-and-water and cigars,
      that he scarcely knew how he reached home. He only remembered that he was
      very dizzy, and that his charming widow&mdash;his guide and friend&mdash;had
      remonstrated with him upon the elevation of his style, and the
      irregularity of his progression.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his head in his hand, and a strong "dish of tea" without milk, before
      him, he was composing himself for business the following morning, when an
      unexpected visitor was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, sir, there's Mrs. Warner's 's boy as wants to speak vith you,"
      said his landlady.

    <p>
      "Show him up," languidly replied our lover, throwing his aching head from
      his right to his left hand.

      "Vell, Jim, vot's the matter!" demanded he&mdash;"How's your missus?"

      "I tell you vot it is, sir, she promised to give me a shillin'-aweek an'

      ain't starved, and ain't seen the color of her money sin' I bin there.

    </p>
    <p>
      "It's some mistake, sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no mistake tho'," persisted Jim, "an' I can tell you she ain't got a
      farden to bless herself vith!&mdash;an' she's over head-and-ears in debt
      too, I can tell you; an' she pays nobody&mdash;puttin' 'em all off, vith
      promises to pay wen she's married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heye!" exclaimed the excited Wiggins, thrown all a-back by this very
      agreeable intention upon his funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "More nor that, sir," continued the revengeful Jim, "I know she thinks as
      she's hooked a preshus flat, an' means to marry you outright jist for vot
      she can get. An' von't she scatter the dibs?&mdash;that's all; she's the

      "Dummies, sir, all dummies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dummies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; the sugars on the shelves is all dummies&mdash;wooden 'uns,
      done up in paper! The herrin' tub is on'y got a few at top&mdash;the
      rest's all shavins an' waste.&mdash;There's plenty o' salt to be sure&mdash;but
      the werry soap-box is all made up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so's my mind!" emphatically exclaimed the deluded Wiggins, slapping
      the breakfast-table with his clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jim&mdash;Jim&mdash;you're a honest lad, and there's half-a-crown for you&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank'ye for me, sir," said the errand-boy, grinning with delight&mdash;"
      "and&mdash;and you'll cut the missus, Sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For ever!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hooray! I said as how I'd have my rewenge!" cried the lad, and pulling
      the front of his straight hair, as an apology for a bow, he retreated from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an escape!" soliloquized Wiggins&mdash;"Should n't I ha' bin
      properly hampered? that's all. No more insinniwating widows for me!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so ended the Courtship of Mr. Wiggins. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      A WANDERING son of Apollo, with a shocking bad hat, encircled by a
      melancholy piece of rusty crape, and arrayed in garments that had once
      shone with renovated splendour in that mart of second-hand habiliments
      'ycleped Monmouth-street, was affrighting the echoes of a fashionable
      street by blowing upon an old clarionet, and doing the 'Follow, hark!' of
      Weber the most palpable injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red hand of the greasy cook tapped at the kitchen-window below, and
      she scolded inaudibly&mdash;but he still continued to amuse&mdash;himself,
      as regardless of the cook's scolding as of the area-railing against which
      he leaned, tuning his discordant lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      His strain indeed appeared endless, and he still persevered in torturing
      the ambient air with, apparently, as little prospect of blowing himself
      out as an asthmatic man would possibly have of extinguishing a smoky link
      with a wheeze&mdash;or a hungry cadger without a penny!
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the mansion was suffering under a touch of the gout,
      accompanied by a gnawing tooth-ache!&mdash;The horrid noise without made
      his trembling nerves jangle like the loose strings of an untuned guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A furious tug at the bell brought down the silken rope and brought up an
      orbicular footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "William"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;&mdash; that, etc.! and send him to, etc.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      And away glided the liveried rotundity.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Appearing at the street-door, the musician took his instrument from his
      lips, and, approaching the steps, touched his sorry beaver with the side
      of his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's three-pence for you," said the menial, "and master wishes you'd
      move on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Threepence, indeed!" mumbled the man. "I never moves on under sixpence:
      d'ye think I doesn't know the walley o' peace and quietness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellow!" cried the irate footman, with a pompous air&mdash;"Master
      desires as you'll go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Werry well"&mdash;replied the other, touching his hat, while the domestic
      waddled back, and closed the door, pluming himself upon having settled the
      musician; but he had no sooner vanished, than the strain was taken up
      again more uproariously than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out he rushed again in a twinkling&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellow! I say&mdash;man! vot do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, now didn't you tell me to go on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean't go off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then vy don't you speak plain hinglish," said the clarionist; "but, I
      say, lug out t'other browns, or I shall say vot the flute said ven his
      master said as how he'd play a tune on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot vos that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, he'd be blow'd if he would!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a owdacious fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tip!" was the laconic answer, accompanied by an expressive twiddling of
      the fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, there then," answered the footman, reluctantly giving him the price
      of his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank'ye," said the musician, "and in time to come, old fellow, never do
      nothin' by halves&mdash;'cept it's a calve's head!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      but somehow or another I never takes nothin' else! My gun's a good 'un and
      no mistake!&mdash;Percussions and the best Dartford, and all that too. My

      The first time as I hentered on the inwigorating and manly sport, I valks

      On a grassy bank, beside a meandering stream, sat two gentlemen averaging
      forty years of age. The day was sultry, and, weary of casting their lines
      without effect, they had stuck their rods in the bank, and sought, in a
      well-filled basket of provisions and copious libations of bottled porter,
      to dissipate their disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't this jolly? and don't you like a day's fishing, Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! werry much, werry much," emphatically replied his friend, taking his
      pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! but some people don't know how to go a-fishinq, Sam; they are such
      fools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a werry good remark o' your'n," observed Sam; "I daresay as how
      hangling is werry delightful vhen the fishes vill bite; but vhen they
      von't, vhy they von't, and vot's the use o' complaining. Hangling is just
      like writing: for instance&mdash;you begins vith, 'I sends you this 'ere
      line hoping,' and they don't nibble; vell! that's just the same as not
      hanswering; and, as I takes it, there the correspondence ends!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly; I'm quite o' your opinion," replied his companion, tossing off a
      bumper of Barclay's best; "I say, Sammy, we mustn't empty t'other bottle
      tho'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vhy not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cos, do you see, I'm just thinking ve shall vant a little porter to carry
      us home: for, by Jingo! I don't think as how either of us can toddle&mdash;that
      is respectably!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! I'd hundertake to walk as straight as a harrow; on'y, I must
      confess, I should like to have a snooze a'ter my pipe; I'm used to it,
      d'ye see, and look for it as nat'rally as a babby does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, but take t'other glass for a nightcap; for you know, Sammy, if you
      sleep vithout, you may catch cold: and, vhatever you do, don't snore, or
      you'll frighten the fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naughty fish!" replied Sammy, "they know they're naughty too, or else
      they voud'nt be so afear'd o' the rod!&mdash;here's your health;" and he
      tossed off the proffered bumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me a-rising to return thanks," replied his friend, grasping
      Sammy's hand, and looking at him with that fixed and glassy gaze which
      indicates the happy state of inebriety, termed maudlin; "I know you're a
      sincere friend, and there ain't nobody as I value more: man and boy have I
      knowed you; you're unchanged! you're the same!! there ain't no
      difference!!! and I hope you may live many years to go a-fishing, and I
      may live to see it, Sammy. Yes, old boy, this here's one of them days that
      won't be forgotten: it's engraved on my memory deep as the words on a
      tombstone, 'Here he lies! Here he lies!'" he repeated with a hiccup, and
      rolled at full length across his dear friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy, nearly as much overcome as his friend, lifted up his head, and
      sticking his hat upon it, knocked it over his eyes, and left him to
      repose; and, placing his own back against an accommodating tree, he
      dropped his pipe, and then followed the example of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few hours deep slumber, they awoke. The sun had gone down, and
      evening had already drawn her star-bespangled mantle over the scene of
      their festive sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arousing themselves, they sought for their rods, and the remnants of their
      provisions, but they were all gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My hey! Sammy, if somebody bas'nt taken advantage of us. My watch too has
      gone, I declare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so's mine!" exclaimed Sammy, feeling his empty fob. "Vell, if this
      ain't a go, never trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you vot it is, Sammy; some clever hartist or another has seen us
      sleeping, like the babes in the wood, and has drawn us at full length!"

      THE BILL-STICKER.

    <p>
      What a mysterious being is the bill-sticker! How seldom does he make
      himself visible to the eyes of the people. Nay, I verily believe there are
      thousands in this great metropolis that never saw a specimen. We see the
      effect, but think not of the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must work at his vocation either at night or at early dawn, before the
      world is stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he is an industrious being, and sticks to business, there cannot be
      the shadow of a doubt, for every dead-wall is made lively by his
      operations, and every hoard a fund of information&mdash;in such type, too,
      that he who runs may read. What an indefatigable observer he must be; for
      there is scarcely a brick or board in city or suburb, however newly
      erected, in highway or byeway, but is speedily adorned by his handiwork&mdash;aye,
      and frequently too in defiance of the threatening&mdash;"BILL-STICKERS,
      BEWARE!"&mdash;staring him in the face. Like nature, he appears to abhor a
      vacuum. When we behold the gigantic size of some of the modern arches, we
      are almost led to suppose that the bill-sticker carries about his placards
      in a four-wheeled waggon, and that his paste-pot is a huge cauldron! How
      he contrives to paste and stick such an enormous sheet so neatly against
      the rugged side of a house, is really astonishing. Whether three or four
      stories high, the same precision is remarkable. We cannot but wonder at
      the dexterity of his practised hand: The union is as perfect as if Dan
      Hymen, the saffron-robed Joiner, had personally superintended the
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind is perhaps the only real enemy he has to fear. How his heart and
      his flimsy paper must flutter in the unruly gusts of a March wind! We only
      imagine him pasting up a "Sale of Horses," in a retired nook, and seeing
      his bill carried away on an eddy!
    </p>
    <p>
      We once had the good fortune to witness a gusty freak of this kind. The
      bill-sticker had affixed a bill upon the hooks of his stick, displaying in
      prominent large characters&mdash;"SALE BY AUCTION&mdash;Mr. GEO. ROBINS&mdash;Capital
      Investment,"&mdash;and so forth, when a sudden whirlwind took the bill off
      the hooks, before it was stuck, and fairly enveloped the countenance of a
      dandy gentleman who happened at the moment to be turning the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a "Capital Investment" was certainly ludicrous in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor bill-sticker was rather alarmed, for he had never stuck a bill
      before on any front that was occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He peeled the gentleman as quickly as possible, and stammered out an
      apology. The sufferer, however, swore he would prefer a bill against him
      at the ensuing sessions. Whether his threat was carried into execution, or
      he was satisfied with the damages already received, we know not. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      There is a certain period of life beyond which the plastic mind of man
      becomes incapable of acquiring any new impressions. He merely elaborates
      and displays the stores he has garnered up in his youth. There are indeed
      some rare exceptions to the rule; but few, very few, can learn a language
      after the age of forty. 'Tis true that Cowper did not commence the
      composition of his delightful poems till he had attained that age; but
      then it must be remembered that he had previously passed a life of study
      and preparation, and that he merely gave the honey to the world which he
      had hived in his youth, bringing to the task a mind polished and matured
      by judgment and experience. But, generally speaking, we rather expect
      reason than rhyme from an elderly gentleman; and when the reverse is the
      case, the pursuit fits them as ridiculously as would a humming-top or a
      hoop. Yet there are many who, having passed a life in the sole occupation
      of making money&mdash;the most unpoetical of all avocations&mdash;that in
      their retirement entertain themselves with such fantastic pranks and
      antics, as only serve to amuse the lookers-on. A retired tradesman, it is
      true, may chase ennui and the 'taedium vitae,' by digging and planting in
      his kitchen-garden, or try his hand at rearing tulips and hyacinths; but
      if he vainly attempt any other art, or dabble in light literature or heavy
      philosophy, he is lost. Old Foozle was one of those who, having
      accumulated wealth, retire with their housekeepers to spend the remnant of
      their days in some suburban retreat, the monotony of whose life is varied
      by monthly trips to town to bring tea and grocery, or purchase some
      infallible remedy for their own gout, or their housekeeper's rheumatism.
      Unfortunately for his peace, Old Foozle accidentally dipped into a
      tattered tome of "Walton's Complete Angler;" and the vivid description of
      piscatorial pleasures therein set forth so won upon his mind, that he
      forthwith resolved to taste them. In vain were the remonstrances of his
      nurse, friend, and factotum. The experiment must be tried. Having more
      money than wit to spare, he presently supplied himself with reels and rods
      and tackle, landing-nets and gentle-boxes, and all the other necessary

    <p>
      Donning his best wig and spectacles, he sallied forth, defended from the
      weather by a short Spencer buttoned round his loins, and a pair of
      double-soled shoes and short gaiters. So eager was he to commence, that he
      no sooner espied a piece of water, than, with trembling hands, he put his
      rod together, and displayed his nets, laying his basket, gaping for the
      finny prey, on the margin of the placid waters. With eager gaze he watched
      his newly-varnished and many-coloured float, expecting every-moment to
      behold it sink, the inviting bait being prepared 'secundum artem.' He had
      certainly time for reflection, for his float had been cast at least an
      hour, and still remained stationary; from which he wisely augured that he
      was most certainly neither fishing in a running stream nor in troubled
      waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a ragged urchin came sauntering along, and very leisurely seated
      himself upon a bank near the devoted angler. Curiosity is natural to
      youth, thought Foozle&mdash;how I shall make the lad wonder when I pull
      out a wriggling fish!
    </p>
    <p>
      But still another weary hour passed, and the old gentleman's arms and
      loins began to ache from the novel and constrained posture in which he
      stood. He grew nervous and uneasy at the want of sport; and thinking that
      perhaps the little fellow was acquainted with the locality, he turned
      towards him, saying, in the blandest but still most indifferent tone he
      could assume, lest he should compromise his dignity by exposing his
      ignorance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, Jack, are there any fish in this pond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be, sir," replied the boy, pulling his ragged forelock most
      deferentially, for Old Foozle had an awful churchwarden-like appearance;
      "there may be, but I should think they were weary small, 'cause there vos
      no vater in this here pond afore that there rain yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sallow cheeks of the old angler were tinged with a ruddy glow, called
      up by the consciousness of his ridiculous position. Taking a penny from
      his pocket, he bade the boy go buy some cakes: and no sooner had he
      gallopped off, than the disappointed Waltonian hastily packed up his
      tackle, and turned his steps homeward; and this was the first and last
      essay of Old Foozle. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      A club, under the imposing style of the "Crack-Shots," met every Wednesday
      evening, during the season, at a house of public entertainment in the
      salubrious suburbs of London, known by the classical sign of the "Magpye
      and Stump." Besides a trim garden and a small close-shaven grass-plat in
      the rear (where elderly gentlemen found a cure for 'taedium vitae' and the
      rheumatism in a social game of bowls), there was a meadow of about five or
      six acres, wherein a target was erected for the especial benefit of the
      members of this celebrated club; we say celebrated, because, of all clubs
      that ever made a noise in the world, this bore away the palm-according to
      the reports in the neighbourhood. Emulation naturally caused excitement,
      and the extraordinary deeds they performed under its influence we should
      never have credited, had we not received the veracious testimony of&mdash;the
      members themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the trials of skill, they generally spent the evenings together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Saggers was the hero of the party; or perhaps he might be more
      appropriately termed the "great gun," and was invariably voted to the
      chair. He made speeches, which went off admirably; and he perpetrated puns
      which, like his Joe Manton, never missed fire, being unanimously voted
      admirable hits by the joyous assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their pleasures and their conversation might truly be said to be of a
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen"&mdash;said Jack, one evening rising upon his legs&mdash;"Do me
      the favour to charge. Are you all primed and loaded? I am about to propose
      the health of a gentleman, who is not only an honour to society at large,
      but to the 'Crack-Shots' in particular. Gentlemen, the mere mention of the
      name of Brother Sniggs&mdash;(hear! hear!)&mdash;I know will call forth a
      volley!&mdash;(Hear! hear!) Gentlemen, I give you the health of Brother
      Sniggs! make ready, present and fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went the glasses, and down went the liquor in a trice, followed by
      three times three, Jack Saggers giving the time, and acting as
      "fugle-man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sniggs, nervously fingering his tumbler of "half and half," as if he
      wanted the spirit to begin, hemmed audibly, and "Having three times shook
      his head <br /> To stir his wit, thus he said,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, I don't know how it is, but somehows the more a man has to
      say, the more he can't! I feel, for all the world, like a gun rammed tight
      and loaded to the muzzle, but without flint or priming&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prime!" exclaimed Jack Saggers; and there was a general titter, and then
      he continued; "as we cannot let you off Sniggs, you most go on, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," resumed Sniggs, "I feel indeed so overloaded by the honors
      you have conferred on me, that I cannot find words to express my
      gratitude. I can only thank you, and express my sincere wish that your
      shots may always tell."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sat down amidst unbounded applause. "By no means a-miss!" cried
      Jack Saggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A joke of mine, when I knocked down a bird the other morning," said
      Sniggs: "you must know I was out early, and had just brought down my bird,
      when leaping into the adjoining field to pick it up, a bird-catcher, who
      had spread his nets on the dewy grass, walked right up to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've a visper for you, Sir," says he, as cool as a cucumber; "I don't
      vish to be imperlite, but next time you shoots a bird vot I've brought to
      my call, I'll shoot you into a clay-pit, that's all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And pray what did you say, Sniggs?" asked Jack Saggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say?&mdash;nothing! but I looked unutterable things, and&mdash;shouldering
      my piece&mdash;walked off!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      "Make a report," cried Jack Saggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must know, that I had lent him my piece for a day's shooting;
      and just as he was sauntering along by a dead wall near Hampstead, looking
      both ways at once for a quarry (for he has a particular squint), a stout
      gentleman in respectable black, and topped by a shovel-hat, happened to be
      coming in the opposite direction. With an expression of terror, the old
      gentleman drew himself up against the unyielding bricks, and
      authoritatively extending his walking-stick, addressed our sportsman in an
      angry tone, saying: 'How dare you carry a loaded gun pointed at people's
      viscera, you booby?' Now Tom is a booby, and no mistake, and so dropping
      his under jaw and staring at the reverend, he answered: 'I don't know vot
      you mean by a wiserar. I never shot a wiserar!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devilish good!" exclaimed Saggers; and, as a matter of course, everybody
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing about the bottle, the club now became hilarious and noisy; when
      the hammer of the president rapped them to order, and knocked down Sniggs
      for a song, who, after humming over the tune to himself, struck up the
      following: <br /> CHAUNT <br />When the snow's on the ground and the trees
      are all bare, <br />And rivers and gutters are turned into ice, <br />The
      sportsman goes forth to shoot rabbit or hare, <br />And gives them a taste
      of his skill in a trice. <br />Bang! bang! goes his Joe, <br />And the
      bird's fall like snow, <br />And he bags all he kills in a trice. <br />
      <br /> CHORUS. <br />Bang! bang! goes his Joe, <br />And the bird's fall like
      snow, <br />And he bags all he kills in a trice. <br /> <br /> II. <br />If he
      puts up a partridge or pheasant or duck, <br />He marks him, and wings him,
      and brings him to earth; <br />He let's nothing fly&mdash;but his piece&mdash;and
      good luck <br />His bag fills with game and his bosom with mirth. <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang! bang! goes his Joe, <br />And the bird's fall like snow, <br />And
      good sport fills his bosom with mirth. <br /> <br /> CHORUS. <br />Bang!
      bang! et. etc. <br /> <br /> III. <br />When at night he unbends and
      encounters his pals, <br />How delighted he boasts of the sport he has had;
      <br />While a kind of round game's on the board, and gals <br />Are toasted
      in bumpers by every lad. <br />And Jack, Jim, and Joe <br />Give the maid

    </p>
    <p>
      The customary applause having followed this vocal attempt of Sniggs, he
      was asked for a toast or a sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's&mdash;'May the charitable man never know the want of&mdash;'shot.'"

    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" demanded Saggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've jist hit it," replied Sorrel, "for it vere worry near 'Vare vhere
      it happened. I'd gone hout hearly, you know, and had jist cotched sight of
      a bird a-vistling on a twig, and puttered the vords, 'I'll spile your
      singin', my tight 'un,' and levelled of my gun, ven a helderly gentleman,
      on t'other side of the bank vich vos atween me and the bird, pops up his
      powdered noddle in a jiffy, and goggling at me vith all his eyes, bawls
      pout in a tantivy of a fright, 'You need'nt be afear'd, sir,' says I, 'I

      vhy, I'm blessed, if I did'nt see the old fellow a-scampering along as
      fast as his legs could carry him. Did'nt I laugh, ready to split&mdash;that's
      all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you what, Sorrel," said the president, with mock gravity, "I
      consider the whole affair, however ridiculous, most immoral and
      reprehensible. What, shall a crack-shot make a target of an elder? Never!
      Let us seek more appropriate butts for our barrels! You may perhaps look
      upon the whole as a piece of pleasantry but let me tell you that you ran a
      narrow chance of being indicted for a breach of the peace! And remember,
      that even shooting a deer may not prove so dear a shot as bringing down an
      old buck!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This humorous reproof was applauded by a "bravo!" from the whole club.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorrel sang&mdash;small, and Sniggs sang another sporting ditty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our next meeting," resumed Saggers, "is on Thursday next when the
      pigeon-match takes place for a silver-cup&mdash;the 'Crack Shots' against
      the 'Oriental Club.' I think we shall give them I taste of our quality,'
      although we do not intend that they shall lick us. The silver-cup is their
      own proposal. The contest being a pigeon-match, I humbly proposed, as an
      amendment, that the prize should be a tumbler&mdash;which I lost by a
      minority of three. In returning thanks, I took occasion to allude to their
      rejection of my proposition, and ironically thanked them for having cut my
      tumbler."

    <p>
      "Werry good!" shouted Sorrel.

    <p>
      "Admirable!" exclaimed Sniggs; and, rising with due solemnity, he proposed
      the health of the "worthy president," prefacing his speech with the modest
      avowal of his inability to do what he still persisted in doing and did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother Shots!" said Saggers, after the usual honours had been duly
      performed, "I am so unaccustomed to speaking (a laugh), that I rise with a
      feeling of timidity to thank you for the distinguished honour you have
      conferred on me. Praise, like wine, elevates a man, but it likewise
      thickens and obstructs his speech; therefore, without attempting any
      rhetorical flourish, I will simply say, I sincerely thank you all for the
      very handsome manner in which you have responded to the friendly wishes of
      Brother Sniggs; and, now as the hour of midnight is at hand, I bid you
      farewell. It is indeed difficult to part from such good company; but,
      although it is morally impossible there ever can be a division among such
      cordial friends, both drunk and sober may at least separate&mdash;in

      was compell'd to buy <br />A horse; and found no trouble, for <br />He'd got
      one in his eye! <br /> <br />He was a tall and bony steed <br />And warranted
      to trot, <br />And so he bought the trotter, and <br />Of course four
      trotters got. <br /> <br />Quoth he: "In sunshine quick he bounds <br />"Across

      came to take the&mdash;air! <br /> <br />But all in vain he tugg'd the rein,

      "Well, Bill, d'ye get any bites over there?" "No, but I'm afeard I shall,
      soon have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two youths, by favour of their sponsors, bearing the aristocratic names of
      William and Joseph, started early one morning duly equipped, on
      piscatorial sport intent. They trudged gaily forward towards a
      neighbouring river, looking right and left, and around them, as sharp as
      two crows that have scented afar off the carcase of a defunct nag.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they arrived at a lofty wall, on the wrong side of which,
      musically meandered the stream they sought. After a deliberate
      consultation, the valiant William resolved to scale the impediment, and
      cast the line. Joseph prudently remained on the other side ready to catch
      the fish&mdash;his companion should throw to him! Presently an exclamation
      of "Oh! my!" attracted his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you got a bite?" eagerly demanded Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! by gosh! but I think I shall soon!" cried Bill. Hereupon the
      expectant Joseph mounted, and seating himself upon the wall, beheld to his
      horror, Master Bill keeping a fierce bull-dog at bay with the butt end of
      his fishing-rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go it, Bill!" exclaimed Joe, "pitch into him and scramble up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog ran at him.&mdash;Joe in his agitation fell from his position,
      while Bill threw his rod at the beast, made a desperate leap, and clutched
      the top of the wall with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egad! I've lost my seat," cried Joe, rolling upon the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so have I!" roared Bill, scrambling in affright over the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And true it was, that he who had not got a bite before, had got a bite&mdash;behind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill anathematised the dog, but the ludicrous bereavement he had sustained
      made him laugh, in spite of his teeth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe joined in his merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a burning shame it is?" said he; "truly there ought to be breaches
      ready made in these walls, Bill, that one might escape, if not repair
      these damages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," replied Bill, shaking his head, "I know the owner&mdash;he's
      a Member of Parliament. Stop till the next election, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what has that to do with it?" demanded Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do with it," said Bill emphatically, "why, I'll canvass for the opposite
      party, to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what then?"
    </p>

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />Round and red, through the morning fog <br />The
      sun's bright face <br />Shone, like some jolly toping dog <br />Of Bacchus'
      race. <br /> <br />When Jenkins, with his gun and cur <br />On sport intent,
      <br />Through fields, and meadows, many fur&mdash; <br />&mdash;longs gaily
      went. <br /> <br />He popp'd at birds both great and small, <br />But nothing
      hit; <br />Or if he hit, they wouldn't fall&mdash; <br />No, not a bit!
      <br /> <br />"It's wery strange, I do declare; <br />I never see! <br />I go
      at sky-larks in the hair <br />Or on a tree." <br /> <br />"It's all the
      same, they fly away <br />Has I let fly&mdash; <br />The birds is
      frightened, I dare say, <br />And vill not die." <br /> <br />"Vhy, here's a
      go! I hav'nt ramm'd <br />In any shot; <br />The birds must think I only
      shamm'd, <br />And none have got." <br /> <br />"I'll undeceive 'em quickly
      now, <br />I bet a crown; <br />And whether fieldfare, tit, or crow, <br />Vill
      bring 'em down." <br /> <br />And as he spake a pigeon flew <br />Across his
      way&mdash; <br />Bang went his piece&mdash;and Jenkins slew <br />The
      flutt'ring prey. <br /> <br />He bagg'd his game, and onward went, <br />When
      to his view <br />Another rose, by fortune sent <br />To make up two. <br />
      <br />He fired, and beheld it fall <br />With inward glee, <br />And for a
      minute 'neath a wall <br />Stood gazing he. <br /> <br />When from behind,
      fierce, heavy blows <br />Fell on his hat, <br />And knock'd his beaver o'er
      his nose, <br />And laid him flat. <br /> <br />"What for," cried Jenkins,
      "am I mill'd, <br />Sir, like this ere?" <br />"You villain, you, why you
      have kill'd <br />My pouter rare." <br /> <br />The sturdy knave who struck
      him down <br />With frown replied:&mdash; <br />"For which I'll make you pay
      a crown <br />Nor be denied." <br /> <br />Poor Jenkins saw it was in vain
      <br />To bandy words; <br />So paid the cash and vow'd, again <br />He'd not
      shoot birds&mdash; <br /> <br />At least of that same feather, lest <br />For
      Pouter shot <br />Some Dragon fierce should him molest&mdash; <br />And fled

      A merry holiday party, forming a tolerable boat-load, and well provided
      with baskets of provisions, were rowing along the beautiful and
      picturesque banks that fringe the river's side near Twickenham, eagerly
      looking out for a spot where they might enjoy their "pic-nic" to
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O! uncle, there's a romantic glade;&mdash;do let us land there!"
      exclaimed a beautiful girl of eighteen summers, to a respectable old
      gentleman in a broad brimmed beaver and spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the thing, I declare," replied he&mdash;"the very spot&mdash;pull
      away, my lads&mdash;but dear me" continued he, as they neared the intended
      landing-place, "What have we here? What says the board?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "PARTIES ARE NOT, ALLOWED TO <br />LAND AND DINE HERE"
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! oh! very well; then we'll only land here, and dine a little further
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a repulsive board"&mdash;cried the young lady&mdash;"I declare now
      I'm quite vex'd"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, Julia, we won't be bored by any board"&mdash;said the jocose
      old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure, uncle"&mdash;said one of the youths&mdash;"we don't require any
      board, for we provide ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're quite right, Master Dickey," said his uncle; "for we only came out
      for a lark, you know, and no lark requires more than a little turf for its
      entertainment; pull close to the bank, and let us land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but suppose," said the timid Julia, "the surly owner should pounce
      upon us, just as we are taking our wine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why then, my love," replied he, "we have only to abandon our wine, and,
      like sober members of the Temperance Society&mdash;take water."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling the wherry close along side the grassy bank, and fastening it
      carefully to the stump of an old tree, the whole party landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How soft and beautiful is the green-sward here," said the romantic Julia,
      indenting the yielding grass with her kid-covered tiny feet; "Does not a
      gentleman of the name of Nimrod sing the pleasure of the Turf?" said Emma:
      "I wonder if he ever felt it as we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," replied Master Dickey, winking at his uncle; "for the
      blades of the Turf he describes, are neither so fresh nor so green as
      these; and the 'stakes' he mentions are rather different from those
      contained in our pigeon-pie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I doubt, Dickey," said his uncle, "if his pen ever described a better
      race than the present company. The Jenkins's, let me tell you, come of a
      good stock, and sport some of the best blood in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful branches of a noble tree," exclaimed Master Dicky, "but, uncle,
      a hard row has made me rather peckish; let us spread the provender. I
      think there's an honest hand of pork yonder that is right worthy of a
      friendly grasp;&mdash;only see if, by a single touch of that magical hand,
      I'm not speedily transformed into a boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a boat?" cried Julia. "A cutter, to be sure," replied Master
      Dicky, and laughing he ran off with his male companions to bring the
      provisions ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the uncle and his niece selected a level spot beneath the
      umbrageous trees, and prepared for the unpacking of the edibles. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Notwithstanding the proverbial variety of the climate, there is no nation
      under the sun so fond of Pic-Nic parties as the English; and yet how
      seldom are their pleasant dreams of rural repasts in the open air fated to
      be realized!
    </p>
    <p>
      However snugly they may pack the materials for the feast, the pack
      generally gets shuffled in the carriage, and consequently their promised
      pleasure proves anything but "without mixture without measure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The jam-tarts are brought to light, and are found to have got a little jam
      too much. The bottles are cracked before their time, and the liberal
      supplies of pale sherry and old port are turned into a&mdash;little
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turn out their jar of ghirkins, and find them mixed, and all their
      store in a sad pickle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leg of mutton is the only thing that has stood in the general melee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plates are all dished, and the dishes only fit for a lunatic asylum,
      being all literally cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the knives and forks are found to ride rusty on the occasion. The
      bread is become sop; and they have not even the satisfaction of getting
      salt to their porridge, for that is dissolved into briny tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the provisions, they find themselves uncomfortably hamper'd; for they
      generally chuse such a very retired spot, that there is nothing to be had
      for love or money in the neighbourhood, for all the shops are as distant
      as&mdash;ninety-ninth cousins!
    </p>
    <p>
      However delightful the scenery may be, it is counterbalanced by the
      prospect of starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although on the borders of a stream abounding in fish, they have neither
      hook nor line; and even the young gentlemen who sing fail in a catch for
      want of the necessary bait. Their spirits are naturally damped by their
      disappointment, and their holiday garments by a summer shower; and though
      the ducks of the gentlemen take the water as favourably as possible, every
      white muslin presently assumes the appearance of a drab, and, becoming a
      little limp and dirty, looks as miserable as a lame beggar!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fine, it is only a donkey or a goose that can reasonably expect to
      obtain a comfortable feed in a field. It may be very poetical to talk of
      "Nature's table-cloth of emerald verdure;" but depend on it, a damask one,
      spread over that full-grown vegetable&mdash;a mahogany table&mdash;is far
      preferable. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      GILES was the eldest son and heir of Jeremiah Styles&mdash;a cultivator of
      the soil&mdash;who, losing his first wife, took unto himself, at the
      mature age of fifty, a second, called by the neighbours, by reason of the
      narrowness of her economy, and the slenderness of her body, Jeremiah's
      Spare-rib.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giles was a "'cute" lad, and his appetite soon became, under his
      step-mother's management, as sharp as his wit; and although he continually
      complained of getting nothing but fat, when pork chanced to form a portion
      of her dietary, it was evident to all his acquaintance that he really got
      lean! His legs, indeed, became so slight, that many of his jocose
      companions amused themselves with striking at them with straws as he
      passed through the farmyard of a morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoy, Giles!" remarked one of them, "thee calves ha' gone to grass, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thee may say that, Jeames," replied Giles; "or d'ye see they did'nt find
      I green enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do think now, Giles," said James, "that Mother Styles do feed thee on
      nothing, and keeps her cat on the leavings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa, she don't," said Giles, "for we boath do get what we can catch, and
      nothing more. Whoy, now, what do you think, Jeames; last Saturday, if the
      old 'ooman did'nt sarve me out a dish o' biled horse-beans&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horse-beans?" cried James; "lack-a-daisy me, and what did you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoy, just what a horse would ha' done, to be sure&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eat 'em?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa&mdash;I kicked, and said 'Nay,' and so the old 'ooman put herself
      into a woundy passion wi' I. 'Not make a dinner of horsebeans, you dainty
      dog,' says she; 'I wish you may never have a worse.'&mdash;'Noa, mother,'
      says I, 'I hope I never shall.' And she did put herself into such a
      tantrum, to be sure&mdash;so I bolted; whereby, d'ye see, I saved my
      bacon, and the old 'ooman her beans. But it won't do. Jeames, I've a
      notion I shall go a recruit, and them I'm thinking I shall get into a
      reg'lar mess, and get shut of a reg'lar row."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dang it, it's too bad!" said the sympathising James; "and when do thee
      go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next March, to be sure," replied Giles, with a spirit which was natural
      to him&mdash;indeed, as to any artificial spirit, it was really foreign to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But thee are such a scare-crow, Giles," said James; "thee are thin as a
      weasel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My drumsticks," answered he, smiling, "may recommend me to the band&mdash;mayhap&mdash;for
      I do think they'll beat anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like sogering neither," said James, thoughtfully. "Suppose the
      French make a hole in thee with a bagnet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoy, then, I shall be 'sewed up,' thee know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's mighty foine," replied James, shaking his head; "but I'd rather
      not, thank'ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Jeames, a mother-in-law's a greater bore than a bagnet, depend on't;
      and it's my mind, it's better to die in a trench than afore an empty
      trencher&mdash;I'll list."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this unalterable determination, the half-starved, though still
      merry Giles, quitted his companion; and the following month, in pursuance
      of the resolve he had made, he enlisted in his Majesty's service.
      Fortunately for the youth, he received more billets than bullets, and
      consequently grew out of knowledge, although he obtained a world of
      information in his travels; and, at the expiration of the war, returned to
      his native village covered with laurels, and in the Joyment of the
      half-pay of a corporal, to which rank he had been promoted in consequence
      of his meritorious conduct in the Peninsula. His father was still living,
      but his step-nother was lying quietly in the church-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, father," said the affectionate Giles, "that thee saw her buried
      in a deep grave, and laid a stone a-top of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am happy," replied Giles. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      WATTY WILLIAMS was a studious youth, with a long nose and a short pair of
      trowsers; his delight was in the green fields, for he was one of those
      philosophers who can find sermons in stones, and good in everything. One
      day, while wandering in a meadow, lost in the perusal of Zimmerman on
      Solitude, he was suddenly aroused from his reverie by a loud "Moo!" and,
      turning about, he descried, to his dismay, a curly-fronted bull making
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Watt., was so good-humoured a fellow, that he could laugh at an Irish
      bull, and withal, so staunch a Protestant, that a papal bull only excited
      a feeling of pity and contempt; but a bull of the breed which was
      careering towards him in such lively bounds, alarmed him beyond all
      bounds; and he forthwith scampered over the meadow from the pugnaceous
      animal with the most agile precipitation imaginable; for he was not one of
      those stout-hearted heroes who could take the bull by the horns&mdash;especially
      as the animal appeared inclined to contest the meadow with him; and though
      so fond of beef (as he naturally was), he declined a round upon the
      present occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing no prospect of escape by leaping stile or hedge, he hopped the
      green turf like an encaged lark, and happily reached a pollard in the
      midst of the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing up with the agility of a squirrel, he seated himself on the
      knobby summit of the stunted willow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still retaining his Zimmerman and his senses, he looked down and beheld
      the corniferous quadruped gamboling playfully round his singular asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pleasant!" exclaimed he; "I suppose, old fellow you want to have a
      game at toss!&mdash;if so, try it on with your equals, for you must see,
      if you have any gumption, that Watty Williams is above you. Aye, you may
      roar!&mdash;but if I sit here till Aurora appears in the east, you won't
      catch me winking. What a pity it is you cannot reflect as well as
      ruminate; you would spare yourself a great deal of trouble, and me a
      little fright and inconvenience."
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal disdainfully tossed his head, and ran at the tree&mdash;and
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away flew the light bark!"
    </p>
    <p>
      in splinters, but the trunk remained unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shoo! shoo!" cried Watty, contemptuously; but he found that shoo'ing
      horns was useless; the beast still butted furiously against the harmless
      pollard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" cried he to a dirty boy peeping at a distance&mdash;"Hallo!" but
      the lad only looked round, and vanished in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The little fool's alarmed, I do believe!" said he; "He's only a cow-boy,
      I dare say!" And with this sapient, but unsatisfactory conclusion, he
      opened his book, and read aloud, to keep up his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bull hearing his voice, looked up with a most melancholy leer, the
      corners of his mouth drawn down with an expression of pathetic gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for Watty, the little boy had given information of his dilemma,
      and the farmer to whom the bull belonged came with some of his men, and
      rescued him from his perilous situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gentleman will stand something to drink, I hope?" said one of the
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly" said Watty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's no more than right," said the farmer, "for, according to the New
      Police Act, we could fine you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, we could all swear that when we found you, you were so elevated you
      could not walk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon his deliverers set up a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watty gave them half-a-crown; saying, with mock gravity&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was on a tree, and you took me off&mdash;that was kind! I was in a
      fright, and you laughed at me; that was uncharitable. Farewell!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      LOUNGING in Hyde Park with the facetious B____, all on a summer's day,
      just at that period when it was the fashion to rail against the beautiful
      statue, erected by the ladies of England, in honour of the Great Captain&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hero of a hundred fights,"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How proudly must he look from the windows of Apsley House," said I, "upon
      this tribute to his military achievements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," replied B____;" and with all that enthusiasm with which one
      man of mettle ever regards another! At the same time, how lightly must he
      hold the estimation of the gallant sons of Britain, when he reflects that
      he has been compelled to guard his laurelled brow from the random bullets
      of a democratic mob, by shot-proof blinds to his noble mansion: this was:
    </p>
    <p>
      'The unkindest cut of all,'
    </p>
    <p>
      after all his hair-breadth 'scapes, by flood and field, in the service. of
      his country, to be compelled to fortify his castle against domestic foes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere passing cloud, that can leave no lasting impression on his great
      mind," said I; "while this statue will for ever remain, a memorial of his
      great deeds; and yet the complaint is general that the statue is
      indelicate&mdash;as if, forsooth, this was the first statue exhibited in
      'puris naturalibus' in England. I really regard it as the senseless
      cavilling of envious minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said B____, laughing; "there is a great deal of railing about the
      figure, but we can all see through it!" at the same time thrusting his
      walking-stick through the iron-fence that surrounds the pedestal. As for
      delicacy, it is a word that is used so indiscriminately, and has so many
      significations, according to the mode, that few people rightly understand
      its true meaning. We say, for instance, a delicate child; and
      pork-butchers recommend a delicate pig! Delicacy and indelicacy depend on
      the mind of the recipient, and is not so much in the object as the
      observer, rely on't. Some men have a natural aptitude in discovering the
      indelicate, both in words and figures they appear, in a manner, to seek
      for it. I assure you that. I (you may laugh if you will) have often been
      put to the blush by the repetition of some harmless phrase, dropped
      innocently from my lips, and warped by one of these 'delicate' gentlemen
      to a meaning the very reverse of what I intended to convey. Like men with
      green spectacles, they look upon every object through an artificial
      medium, and give it a colour that has no existence in itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only last week, I was loitering about this very spot, when I
      observed, among the crowd of gazers, a dustman dressed in his best, and
      his plump doxy, extravagantly bedizened in her holiday clothes, hanging on
      his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they turned away, the lady elevated the hem of her rather short
      garments a shade too high (as the delicate dustman imagined) above her
      ancle. He turned towards her, and, in an audible whisper, said, 'Delicacy,
      my love&mdash;'delicacy!'&mdash;'Lawks, Fred!' replied the damsel, with a
      loud guffaw,'&mdash;'it's not fashionable!&mdash;besides, vot's the good
      o' having a fine leg, if one must'nt show it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for opinions on delicacy! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      SINCE the invention of steam, thousands have been tempted to inhale the
      saline salubrity of the sea, that would never have been induced to try,
      and be tried, by the experiment of a trip. Like hams for the market, every
      body is now regularly salted and smoked. The process, too, is so cheap!
      The accommodations are so elegant, and the sailors so smart! None of the
      rolling roughness of quid-chewing Jack-tars. Jack-tars! pshaw! they are
      regular smoke jacks on board a steamer! The Steward ("waiter" by half the
      cockneys called) is so ready and obliging; and then the provisions is
      excellent. Who would not take a trip to Margate? There's only one thing
      that rather adulterates the felicity&mdash;a drop of gall in the cup of
      mead!&mdash;and that is the horrid sea-sickness! learnedly called
      nostalgia; but call it by any name you please, like a stray dog, it is
      pretty sure to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold perspiration&mdash;the internal commotion&mdash;the brain's
      giddiness&mdash;the utter prostration of strength&mdash;the Oh! I never
      shall forget the death-like feel!&mdash;Fat men rolling on the deck, like
      fresh caught porpoises; little children floundering about; and white
      muslins and parasols vanishing below! The smoking-hot dinner sends up its
      fumes, and makes the sick more sick. Soda-water corks are popping and
      flying about in every direction, like a miniature battery pointed against
      the assaults of the horrid enemy!

      "Steward!" faintly cries a fat bilious man, "bring me a glass of brandy as

      no power over the rolling sea, or its reaches!

    <p>
      "O! my poor pa!" exclaims the interesting Wilhelmina; and is so overcome,
      that she, sweet sympathizer! is soon below pa in the ladies' cabin. In

      The pier at last appears&mdash;and the cargo of drooping souls hail it

      They hurry from the boat as if 'twere Charon's, and they were about

    <p>
      A change comes o'er the spirit of their dream&mdash;their nerves are
      braced; and so soon are mortal troubles obliterated from the mind, that in
      a few days they are ready again to tempt the terrors of sea-sickness in a
      voyage homewards&mdash;notwithstanding many of them, in their extremity,
      had vowed that they never would return by water, if they outlived the
      present infliction; considering, naturally enough, that it was "all up"

      THE good ship Firefly tossed and tumbled on the mountainous waves of the
      stormy sea, like a cork in a gutter; and when she could not stem the
      waves, politically tried a little tergiversation, and went stern foremost!
      The boatswain piped all hands, and poor Peter Simple piped his eye; for
      the cry of the whole crew was, that they were all going to Davy Jones's
      locker. The waves struck her so repeatedly, that at last she appeared as
      ungovernable as a scold in a rage; and as she found she could not, by any
      means, strike the storm in the wind, and so silence it, she gave vent to
      her fury by striking upon a rock!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard alternative truly; but what could she do? The long boat was
      soon alongside, and was not long before it was filled with tars and
      salt-water. Alas! she was speedily swamped, and the crew were compelled to
      swim for their lives. Peter, however, could not swim, but the sea gave him
      a lift in his dilemma, and washed him clean ashore, where he lay for some
      time like a veritable lump of salt-Peter! When the storm had abated he
      came to himself, and of course found himself in no agreeable company!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sticking his cocked-hat on his head, and grasping his dirk in his hand, he
      tottered to a rock, when, seating himself, he philosophically rocked to
      and fro. "Oh! vy vos I a midshipman," cried he, "to be wrecked on this
      desolate island? I vish I vos at home at Bloomsbury! Oh! that I had but to
      turn and embrace my kind, good, benevolent, and much respected
      grandmother." As he uttered this pathetic plaint, he heard a chatter&mdash;of
      which, at first considering that it proceeded from his own teeth, he took
      no notice&mdash;but the sounds being repeated, he turned his head, and
      beheld a huge baboon with a dog-face and flowing hair, grinning with
      admiration at his cocked hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One look was sufficient! he leaped from his seat, and rushed wildly
      forward, threading a wood in his way, and turning in and out&mdash;in and
      out&mdash;with the sharpness and facility of a needle in the heel of a
      worsted stocking&mdash;he never stayed his flight, 'till he fell plump
      into the centre of a group of Indians, who received him with a yell!&mdash;loud
      enough to split the drums of a whole drawing-room full of ears polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have fallen headlong with fear and exhaustion upon the turf, had
      not a gentle female caught the slender youth in her arms, and embraced him
      with all the energetic affection of a boa-constrictor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter trembled like a little inoffensive mouse in the claws of a tabby!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time one of the Indians stepped forward, brandishing his
      scalping knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the very prototype of an animated bronze Hercules; and, seizing the
      poor middy's lank locks, with a peculiar twist, in his iron grasp&mdash;
      Peter fainted! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      MOST luckily for poor Peter was it, that he fell into the hands, or rather
      the arms, of the Indian maid; for she not only preserved his crop, but his
      life. When he recovered from his swoon, he found himself seated beside his
      preserver, who, with one arm round his waist, was holding a cocoa-nut,
      filled with a refreshing beverage, to his parched and pallid lips. A large
      fire blazed in the middle of the wide space occupied by the Indians, and
      he beheld the well-known coats and jackets of the brave crew of the
      Firefly scattered on the greensward.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart palpitated-he thought at first that the villainous Indians had
      stripped them, and left them to wander in a state of nature through the
      tangled and briery woods. He was, however, soon&mdash;too soon&mdash;convinced
      that the savages had dressed them! Yes, that merry crew&mdash;who had so
      often roasted him&mdash;had been roasted by the Indians!
    </p>
    <p>
      From this awful fate the lovely Ootanga had preserved him. She had
      suddenly conceived a violent affection for the young white-face; and,
      after a long harangue to the chief, her father, his consent was obtained,
      and the nuptials were celebrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I smell a rat," said Peter&mdash;"I'm booked; but better booked than
      cooked, at any rate;" and forthwith returned thanks to the company for the
      honour they had conferred upon him, in the fashion of an after-dinner
      speech, accompanied with as much pantomime as he could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dance and a feast followed, of which Peter partook; but whether rabbit,
      squirrel, or monkey, formed the basis of his wedding-supper, he was not
      naturalist enough to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ootanga's affection, however, was sufficient to make amends for anything;
      she was, in truth, a most killing beauty, for she brought him tigers slain
      by her own hands, and made a couch for him of the skins.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught rattlesnakes for him, and spitch-cooked them for his breakfast.
      In fact, there was nothing she left undone to convince him of her
      unbounded love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's heart, however, was untouched by all this show of tenderness; for
      the fact is, he had already given his heart to a white-face in his own
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only consolation he had in his forlorn situation was to talk of her
      continually; and, as Ootanga understood not a syllable of what he uttered,
      she naturally applied all his tender effusions to herself, and laughed and
      grinned, and showed her white teeth, as if she would devour her little
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated on a tiger skin, with his lawful spouse beside him, arrayed in
      shells, bows, feathers, and all the adornments of a savage bride, he still
      sighed for home, and plaintively exclaimed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here I am, married to the only daughter of the great chief, who would
      have roasted me with the rest of our crew, had I not given a joyful
      consent. Oh! I wonder if I ever shall get home, and be married to Miss
      Wiggins!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lovely wide-mouthed Ootanga patted him fondly on the chin, and dreamed
      in her ignorance that he was paying her a compliment in his native
      language. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      IT may be accepted as an indubitable truth, that when the tenderest
      epithets are bandied between a married couple, that the domestic affairs
      do not go particularly straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs and his rib were perhaps the most divided pair that ever were yoked
      by Hymen. D. was a good-humored fellow, a jovial blade, full of high
      spirits&mdash;while his wife was one of the most cross-grained and
      cantankerous bodies that ever man was blessed with&mdash;and yet, to hear
      the sweet diminutives which they both employed in their dialogues, the
      world would have concluded that they were upon the best terms conceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My love," quoth Mrs. D., "I really now should like to take a boat and row
      down the river as far as Battersea; the weather is so very fine, and you
      know, my dear love, how fond I am of the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      D. could have added (and indeed it was upon the very tip of his tongue)&mdash;"mixed
      with spirits"&mdash;but he wisely restrained the impertinent allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my duck," said he, "you have only to name the day, you know, I am
      always ready to please,"&mdash;and then, as was his habit, concluded his
      gracious speech by singing&mdash; "'Tis woman vot seduces all mankind&mdash;
      <br /> Their mother's teach them the wheedling art."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your nonsense, do," replied Mrs. D____, scarcely able to restrain
      her snappish humour, but, fearful of losing the jaunt, politically added,
      "Suppose, love, we go to-day&mdash;no time like the present, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thine am I&mdash;thine am I," sang the indulgent husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. D____ hereupon ordered the boy to carry down to the stairs a
      cargo of brandy, porter, and sandwiches, for the intended voyage, and
      taking her dear love in the humour, presently appeared duly decked out for
      the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two watermen and a wherry were soon obtained, and Dobbs, lighting his
      cigar, alternately smoked and sang, while his duck employed herself most
      agreeably upon the sandwiches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright and sunny, and exceedingly hot; and they had scarcely
      rowed as far as the Red-House, when Mrs. D____became rather misty, from
      the imbibation of the copious draughts she had swallowed to quench her
      thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lighter being a-head, the boatmen turned round, while Dobbs, casting up
      his eyes to the blue heavens, was singing, in the hilarity of his heart,
      "Hearts as warm as those above, lie under the waters cold," when the boat
      heeled, and his duck, who unfortunately could not swim, slipped gently
      over the gunwhale, and, unnoticed, sank to rise no more.
    </p>

      Among all the extraordinary and fantastic dishes compounded for the palate
      of Heliogabalus, the Prince of Epicures, that delicious admixture of the
      animal and the vegetable&mdash;Strawberries and Cream&mdash;is never
      mentioned in the pages of the veracious chronicler of his gastronomic
      feats!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! 'tis a lamentable truth, this smooth, oleaginous, and delicately
      odorous employment for the silver spoon, was unknown. Should the knowledge
      of his loss reach him in the fields of Elysium, will not his steps be
      incontinently turned towards the borders of the Styx&mdash;his plaintive
      voice hail the grim ferryman, while in his most persuasive tones he cries&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Row me back&mdash;row me back,"
    </p>
    <p>
      that he may enjoy, for a brief space, this untasted pleasure? Ye gods! in
      our mind's eye we behold the heartless and unfeeling Charon refuse his
      earnest prayer, and see his languid spirit&mdash;diluted by disappointment
      to insipidity&mdash;wandering over the enamelled meads, as flat and
      shallow as an overflow in the dank fens of Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      His imagination gloats upon the fragrant invention, and he gulps at the
      cheating shadow until Elysium becomes a perfect Hades to his tortured
      spirit.

      Mellow, rich, and toothsome compound! Toothsome did we say? Nay, even
      those who have lost their 'molares, incisores,' canine teeth, 'dentes

      dearest Pol, be quick." <br /> <br />"Vhy, this is it:&mdash;I think ve
      might <br />To Hornsey have a day; <br />Maria, Peg, and Sal, and Bet <br />Ve'd
      pack into a 'chay.' <br /> <br />"Our Jim and Harry both could valk, <br />(God
      bless their little feet!) <br />The babby in my arms I'd take&mdash; <br />I'm
      sure 'twould be a treat;" <br /> <br />Quoth he: "I am unanimous!" <br />And
      so the day was fix'd; <br />And forth they started in good trim, <br />Tho'
      not with toil umnix'd. <br /> <br />Across his shoulders Sibson bore <br />A
      basket with the "grub," <br />And to the "chay" perform'd the "horse,"
      <br />Lest Mrs. S____ should snub. <br /> <br />Apollo smiled!&mdash;that is,
      the sun <br />Blazed in a cloudless sky, <br />And Sibson soon was in a
      "broil" <br />By dragging of his "fry." <br /> <br />Says S____, "My love,
      I'm dry as dust!" <br />When she replied, quite gay, <br />"Then, drink; for
      see I've bottled up <br />My spirits for the day." <br /> <br />And from the
      basket drew a flask, <br />And eke a footless glass; <br />He quaff'd the
      drink, and cried, "Now, dear, <br />I'm strong as ____" let that pass!
      <br /> <br />At last they reach'd the destined spot <br />And prop and babes
      unpacked; <br />They ran about, and stuff'd, and cramm'd, <br />And really
      nothing lack'd. <br /> <br />And Sibson, as he "blew a cloud," <br />Declared,
      "It vos a day!" <br />And vow'd that he would come again&mdash; <br />Then
      call'd for "Vot's to pay?" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      I ONCE followed a venerable gentleman along the banks of a mill-stream,
      armed at all points with piscatorial paraphernalia, looking out for some
      appropriate spot, with all the coolness of a Spanish inquisitor,
      displaying his various instruments of refined torture. He at last perched
      himself near the troubled waters, close to the huge revolving wheel, and
      threw in his float, which danced upon the mimic waves, and bobbed up and
      down, as if preparing for a reel. Patiently he sat; as motionless and
      unfeeling as a block. I placed myself under cover of an adjoining hedge,
      and watched him for the space of half an hour; but he pulled up nothing
      but his baited hook;&mdash;what his bait was, I know not; but I suppose,
      from the vicinity, he was fishing for a "miller's thumb." Presently, two
      mealy-mouthed men, from the mill, made their appearance, cautiously
      creeping behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew myself up in the shadow of the luxuriant quickset to observe their
      notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A paling in the rear offered the rogues an effectual concealment in case
      the angler should turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close to his seat ran some wood-work, upon which they quietly drew the
      broad tails of his coat, and driving in a couple of tenpenny nails, left
      the unconscious old gentleman a perfect fixture; to be taken at a
      valuation, I suppose, part of his personal property being already "brought
      to the hammer!" the clattering clamour of the wheel precluding him from
      hearing the careful, but no less effectual taps. I certainly enjoyed the
      trick, and longed to see the ridiculous issue; but he was so intent upon
      his sport&mdash;so fixed that he did not discover the nature of his real
      attachment while I remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless if he were of a quick and sudden temperament, a snatch of his
      humour rent his broad cloth, and he returned home with a woful tail, and
      slept not&mdash;for his nap was irreparably destroyed!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate all twaddle; but when I see an old fool, with rod and line,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sitting like patience on a monument,"
    </p>
    <p>
      and selling the remnant of his life below cost price in the pursuit of
      angling,&mdash;that "art of ingeniously tormenting,"&mdash;a feeling,
    </p>
    <p>
      "More in sorrow than in anger,"
    </p>
    <p>
      is excited at his profitless inhumanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainly do all the disciples of honest Izaak Walton discourse, in
      eulogistic strains, of the pleasure of the sport. I can imagine neither
      pleasure nor sport derivable from the infliction of pain upon the meanest
      thing endowed with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be deemed Brahminical, but I doubt that man's humanity who can
      indulge in the cruel recreation and murder while he smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, heretical sentiments," exclaims some brother of the angle, (now I
      am an angle, but no angler.) "This fellow hath never trudged at early dawn
      along the verdant banks of the 'sedgy lea,' and drunk in the dewy
      freshness of the morning air. His lines have never fallen in pleasant
      places. He has never performed a pilgrimage to Waltham Cross. He is, in
      truth, one of those vulgar minds who take more delight in the simple than
      the&mdash;gentle!&mdash;and every line of his deserves a rod!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "WELL, this is a morning!" emphatically exclaimed a stripling, with a
      mouth and eyes formed by Nature of that peculiar width and power of
      distension, so admirably calculated for the expression of stupid wonder or
      surprise; while his companion, elevating his nasal organ and projecting
      his chin, sniffed the fresh morning breeze, as they trudged through the
      dewy meadows, and declared that it was exactly for all the world
      similar-like to reading Thomson's Seasons! In which apt and appropriate
      simile the other concurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom's a good fellow to lend us his gun," continued he&mdash;"I only hope
      it ain't given to tricking, that's all. I say, Sugarlips, keep your powder
      dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me alone for that," replied Sugarlips; "I know a thing or two,
      although this is the first time that ever I have been out. What a
      scuffling the birds do make"&mdash;added he, peeping into the cage which
      they had, as a precautionary measure, stocked with sparrows, in order that
      they might not be disappointed in their sport&mdash;"How they long to be
      on the wing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wing 'em, presently!" cried his comrade, with a vaunting air&mdash;
      "and look if here ain't the very identical spot for a display of my skill.
      Pick out one of the best and biggest, and tie up a-top of yonder stile,
      and you shall soon have a specimen of my execution." Sugarlips quickly did
      his bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now&mdash;come forward and stand back! What do ye think o' that, ey?"
      said the sportsman&mdash;levelling his gun, throwing back his head,
      closing his sinister ocular, and stretching out his legs after the manner
      of the Colossus of Rhodes&mdash;"Don't you admire my style?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent!" said Sugarlips&mdash;"But I think I could hit it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, the stile to be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep quiet, can't you&mdash;Now for it&mdash;" and, trembling with
      eagerness, his hand pulled the trigger, but no report followed. "The deuce
      is in the gun," cried he, lowering it, and examining the lock; "What can
      ail it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I'll be shot if that ain't prime," exclaimed Sugarlips, laughing
      outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've only forgot the priming&mdash;that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a pretty fellow, you are, for a sportsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's no matter as it happens; for, though 'Time and tide wait for
      no man,' a sparrow tied must, you know. There! that will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you put the shot in now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you put the shot into Dicky as surely, he'll never peck groundsel
      again, depend on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the "murderous tube" was levelled; Sugarlips backed against an
      adjoining wall, with a nervous adhesiveness that evidently proved him less
      fearful of a little mortar than a great gun!
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right; out of the way, Sugarlips; I am sure I shall hit him this
      time." And no sooner had he uttered this self-congratulatory assurance
      (alas! not life-assurance!) than a report (most injurious to the innocent
      cock-sparrow) was heard in the neighbourhood!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder!&mdash;mur-der!" roared a stentorian voice, which made the
      criniferous coverings of their craniums stand on end
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like quills upon the fretful porcupine."
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the sportsman let fall his gun, and Sugarlips ran affrighted
      towards the stile. He found it really "vox et preterea nihil;" for a few
      feathers of the bird alone were visible: he had been blown to nothing;
      and, peeping cautiously round the angle of the wall, he beheld a portly
      gentleman in black running along with the unwieldy gait of a chased
      elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Flank'em, of the Finishing Academy, by jingo!" exclaimed Sugarlips.
      "It's a mercy we didn't finish him! Why, he must actually have been on the
      point of turning the corner. I think we had better be off; for, if the old
      dominie catches us, he will certainly liberate our sparrows, and&mdash;put
      us in the cage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, where's the spoil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoil, indeed!" cried Sugarlips; "you've spoiled him nicely. I've an
      idea, Tom, you were too near, as the spendthrift nephew said of his
      miserly uncle. If you can't get an aim at a greater distance, you'd never
      get a name as a long shot&mdash;that's my mind." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Uncle Samson was a six-bottle man. His capacity was certainly great,
      whatever might be said of his intellect; for I have seen him rise without
      the least appearance of elevation, after having swallowed the customary
      half dozen. He laughed to scorn all modern potations of wishy-washy French
      and Rhine wines&mdash;deeming them unfit for the palate of a true-born
      Englishman. Port, Sherry, and Madeira were his only tipple&mdash;the rest,

      his predilection for the Port, to be a true Mussulman. To hear him
      discourse upon the age of his wines&mdash;the 'pinhole,' the 'crust,' the
      'bees'-wing,' etc., was perfectly edifying&mdash;and every man who could
      not imbibe the prescribed quantum, became his butt. To temperance and
      tea-total societies he attributed the rapid growth of radicalism and
      dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Water," he would say, with a sort of hydrophobic shudder, "is only a fit
      beverage for asses!"&mdash;"To say a man could drink like a fish, was once
      the greatest encomium that a bon-vivant could bestow upon a brother
      Bacchanalian&mdash;but, alas! in this matter-of-fact and degenerate age,
      men do so literally&mdash;washing their gills with unadulterated water!&mdash;Dropsy
      and water on the chest must be the infallible result! If such an order of
      things continue, all the puppies in the kingdom, who would perhaps have
      become jolly dogs in their time, will be drowned! Yes, they'll inevitably
      founder, like a water-logged vessel, in sight of port. These
      water-drinkers will not have a long reign. They would feign persuade us
      that 'Truth lies at the bottom of a well,'&mdash;lies, indeed! I tell you
      Horace knew better, and that his assertion of 'There is truth in wine,'
      was founded on experience&mdash;his draughts had no water-mark in 'em,
      depend on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a great buyer of choice "Pieces," and his cellar contained one of
      the best stocks in the kingdom, both in the wood and bottle. Poor Uncle!&mdash;he
      has now been some years "in the wood" himself, and snugly stowed in the
      family vault!
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been attacked with a severe cold, he was compelled to call in the
      Doctor, who sent him a sudorific in three Lilliputian bottles; but
      although he received the advice of his medical friend, he followed
      Shakspeare's,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Throw physic to the dogs,"
    </p>
    <p>
      and prescribed for himself a bowl of wine-whey as a febrifuge. His
      housekeeper remonstrated, but he would have his 'whey,' and he died!
      leaving a handsome fortune, and two good-looking nephews to follow him to
      the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Myself and Cousin (the two nephews aforesaid) were vast favourites with
      the old gentleman, and strenuously did he endeavour to initiate us in the
      art of drinking, recounting the feats of his youth, and his drinking-bouts
      with my father, adding, with a smile, "But you'll never be a par with,
      your Uncle, Ned, till you can carry the six bottles under your waistcoat."
    </p>
    <p>
      My head was certainly stronger than my Cousin's; he went as far as the
      third bottle&mdash;the next drop was on the floor! Now I did once manage
      the fourth bottle&mdash;but then&mdash;I must confess I was obliged to
      give it up!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young men," would my Uncle say, "should practice 'sans intermission,'
      until they can drink four bottles without being flustered, then they will
      be sober people; for it won't be easy to make them tipsy&mdash;a drunken
      man I abominate!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      THERE are some individuals so inflated with self-sufficiency, and
      entertain such an overweaning opinion of their skill in all matters, that
      they must needs have a finger in every pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a finer specimen than old V____, of this genius of egotistic,
      meddling mortals, never existed. He was a man well-to-do in the world, and
      possessed not only a large fortune, but a large family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an idea that no man was better qualified to bring up his children
      in the way they should go; and eternally plagued the obsequious tutors of
      his sons with his novel mode of instilling the rudiments of the Latin
      tongue, although he knew not a word of the language; and the obedient
      mistresses of his daughters with his short road to attaining a perfection
      in playing the piano-forte, without knowing a note of the gamut: but what
      could they say; why, nothing more or less than they were 'astonished;'
      which was vague enough to be as true as it was flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he was so universally clever, that he even interfered in the
      culinary department of his household, instructing the red-elbowed, greasy,
      grinning Cook, in the sublime art of drawing, stuffing, and roasting a
      goose, for which she certainly did not fail to roast the goose (her
      master) when she escaped to the regions below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his medical attendant was compelled to acknowledge the efficacy of
      his domestic prescriptions of water-gruel and honey in catarrhs, and
      roasted onions in ear-aches, and sundry other simple appliances; and, in
      fine, found himself, on most occasions, rather a 'consulting surgeon,'
      than an apothecary, for he was compelled to yield to the man who had
      studied Buchan's and Graham's Domestic Medicine. And the only consolation
      he derived from his yielding affability, were the long bills occasioned by
      the mistakes of this domestic quack, who was continually running into
      errors, which required all his skill to repair. Nay, his wife's
      mantua-maker did not escape his tormenting and impertinent advice; for he
      pretended to a profound knowledge in all the modes, from the time of
      Elizabeth to Victoria, and deemed his judgment in frills, flounces, and
      corsages, as undeniable and infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the sempstress flattered his taste; for his wife, poor soul! she
      soon had tact enough to discover, had no voice in the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eldest son, George, had a notion that he could angle. Old V____
      immediately read himself up in Walton, and soon convinced&mdash;himself,
      that he was perfect in that line, and quite capable of teaching the whole
      art and mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, George," said he, when they had arrived at a convenient spot for
      their first attempt, "this is the way to handle your tackle; drop it
      gently into the water,&mdash;so!" and, twirling the line aloft, he hooked
      the branches of an overhanging tree!&mdash;sagaciously adding, "You see I
      make no splash! and hold your rod in this manner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George was too much afraid of his imperious father, to point out his
      error, and old V____ consequently stood in the broiling sun for a full
      quarter of an hour, before he discovered that he had caught a birch
      instead of a perch! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      A MUSICAL FESTIVAL.

      Matter-of-fact people read the story of Orpheus, and imagine that his
      "charming rocks" and "soothing savage beasts," is a mere fabulous
      invention. No such thing: it is undoubtedly founded on fact. Nay, we could
      quote a thousand modern instances of the power of music quite as
      astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One most true and extraordinary occurrence will suffice to establish the
      truth of our proposition beyond a doubt. Molly Scraggs was a cook in a
      first-rate family, in the most aristocratic quarter of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master and mistress were abroad, and Molly had nothing to do but to
      indulge her thoughts; and, buried as she was in the pleasant gloom and
      quiet of an underground kitchen, nothing could possibly be more favourable
      to their developement. She was moreover exceedingly plump, tender, and
      sentimental, and had had a lover, who had proved false to his vows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this eligible situation and temper for receiving soft impressions, she
      sat negligently rocking herself in her chair, and polishing the lid of a
      copper saucepan! when the sweet, mellifluous strains of an itinerant band
      struck gently upon the drum of her ear. "Wapping Old Stairs" was
      distinctly recognized, and she mentally repeated the words so applicable
      to her bereaved situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Molly has never proved false she declares," 'till the tears
      literally gushed from her "blue, blue orbs," and trickled down her plump
      and ruddy cheeks; but scarcely had she plunged into the very depths of the
      pathos induced by the moving air, which threatened to throw her into a
      gentle swoon, or kicking hysterics, when her spirit was aroused by the
      sudden change of the melancholy ditty, to the rampant and lively tune,
      with the popular burden of, "Turn about and wheel about, and jump Jim
      Crow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This certainly excited her feelings; but, strange to say, it made her leap
      from her chair, exasperated, as it were, by the sudden revulsion, and rush
      into the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, for goodness sake, play that horrid 'chune,'" said Molly,
      emphatically addressing the minstrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'fiddle' immediately put his instrument under his arm, and, touching
      the brim of his napless hat, scraped a sort of bow, and smilingly asked
      the cook to name any other tune she preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Play us," said she, "'Oh! no, we never mention her,' or summat o' that
      sort; I hate jigs and dances mortally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, marm," replied the 'fiddle,' obsequiously; and, whispering the
      'harp' and 'bass,' they played the air to her heart's content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if one might guess by the agility with which she ran into the
      kitchen, she was quite melted; and, returning with the remnants of a
      gooseberry pie and the best part of a shoulder of mutton, she handed them
      to the musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanky'e, marm, I'm sure," said the 'bass,' sticking his teeth into the
      pie-crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mutton 's rayther fat, but it 's sweet, at any rate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, marm," said the 'fiddle;' "it's too fat for your stomach, I'm sure,
      marm;" and consigned it to his green-baize fiddle-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Molly,&mdash;"play us, 'Drink to me only,' and I'll draw you a
      mug o' table-ale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're vastly kind," said the 'fiddle;' "it's a pleasure to play anythink
      for you, marm, you've sich taste;" and then turning to his comrades, he
      added, with a smile&mdash;"By goles! if she ain't the woppingest cretur as
      ever I set eyes on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The tune required was played, and the promised ale discussed. The 'bass,'
      with a feeling of gratitude, voted that they should give a parting air
      unsolicited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot shall it be?" demanded the 'harp.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vy, considering of her size," replied the 'fiddle,' "I thinks as nothink
      couldn't be more appropriate than:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farewell to the mountain !'"
    </p>
    <p>
      and, striking up, they played the proposed song, marching on well pleased
      with the unexpected appreciation of their musical talent by the kind, and
      munificent Molly Scraggs! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      THE EATING HOUSE.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      FROM twelve o'clock until four, the eating houses of the City are crammed
      with hungry clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bills of fare have not yet been introduced,&mdash;the more's the pity;
      but, in lieu thereof, you are no sooner seated in one of the snug inviting
      little settles, with a table laid for four or six, spread with a snowy
      cloth, still bearing the fresh quadrangular marks impressed by the mangle,
      and rather damp, than the dapper, ubiquitous waiter, napkin in hand,
      stands before you, and rapidly runs over a detailed account of the
      tempting viands all smoking hot, and ready to be served up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beef, boiled and roast; veal and ham; line of pork, roast; leg boiled,
      with pease pudding; cutlets, chops and steaks, greens, taters, and pease,"
      etc. etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some are fastidious, and hesitate; the waiter, whose eyes are 'all about
      him,' leaves you to meditate and decide, while he hastens to inform a new
      arrival, and mechanically repeats his catalogue of dainties; and, bawling
      out at the top of his voice, "One roast beaf and one taters," you echo his
      words, and he straightway reports your wishes in the same voice and manner
      to the invisible purveyors below, and ten to one but you get a piece of
      boiled fat to eke out your roast meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some houses, new and stale bread, at discretion, are provided; and many
      a stripling, lean and hungry as a greyhound, with a large appetite and a
      small purse, calls for a small plate, without vegetables, and fills up the
      craving crannies with an immoderate proportion of the staff of life, while
      the reckoning simply stands, "one small plate 6d., one bread 1d., one
      waiter 1d.;" and at this economical price satisfies the demands of his
      young appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, cheap as this appears, he pays it the aggregate, for there are
      frequently 500 or 600 diners daily at these Establishments; and the
      waiter, who generally purchases his place, and provides glass, cloths,
      etc. not only makes a 'good thing of it,' but frequently accumulates
      sufficient to set up on his own account, in which case, he is almost sure
      of being followed by the regular customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he is universally so obliging, and possesses such a memory, and an
      aptness in discovering the various tastes of his visitors, that he seldom
      fails in making most of the every-day feeders his fast friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom, bring me a small plate of boiled beef and potatoes," cries one of
      his regulars. Placing his hand upon the table-cloth; and knocking off the
      crumbs with his napkin, he bends to the gentleman, and in a small.
      confidential voice informs him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beef won't do for you, Sir,&mdash;it's too low, it's bin in cut a
      hour. Fine ribs o' lamb, jist up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do, Tom," says the gratified customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grass or spinach, Sir? fine 'grass,'&mdash;first this season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring it, and quick, Tom," replies the gentleman, pleased with the
      assiduous care he takes in not permitting him to have an indifferent cut
      of a half cold joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most extraordinary part of the business is, the ready manner in which
      he 'casts up' all you have eaten, takes the reckoning, and then is off
      again in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stranger, and one unaccustomed to feed in public, is recognised in a
      moment by his uneasy movements. He generally slinks into the nearest
      vacant seat, and is evidently taken aback by the apparently abrupt and
      rapid annunciation of the voluble and active waiter, and, in the hurry and
      confusion, very frequently decides upon the dish least pleasant to his
      palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A respectable gentleman of the old school, of a mild and reverend
      appearance, and a lean and hungry figure, once dropped into a settle where
      we were discussing a rump steak and a shallot, tender as an infant, and
      fragrant as a flower garden! Tom pounced upon him in a moment, and uttered
      the mystic roll. The worthy senior was evidently confused and startled,
      but necessity so far overcame his diffidence that he softly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "A small portion of veal and ham, well done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, whirled round, continuing the application of his eternal napkin to a
      tumbler which he was polishing, bawled out in a stentorian voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plate o' weal, an' dam well done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall never sponge from the slate of our memory the utter astonishment
      expressed in the bland countenance of the startled old gentleman at this
      peculiar echo of his wishes. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />JOB Timmins was a tailor bold, <br />And well he
      knew his trade, <br />And though he was no fighting man <br />Had often
      dress'd a blade! <br /> <br />Quoth he, one day&mdash;"I have not had <br />A
      holiday for years, <br />So I'm resolv'd to go and fish, <br />And cut for
      once the shears." <br /> <br />So donning quick his Sunday's suit, <br />He
      took both rod and line, <br />And bait for fish&mdash;and prog for one,
      <br />And eke a flask of wine. <br /> <br />For he was one who loved to live,
      <br />And said&mdash;"Where'er I roam <br />I like to feed&mdash;and though
      abroad, <br />To make myself at home." <br /> <br />Beneath a shady grove of
      trees <br />He sat him down to fish, <br />And having got a cover, he <br />Long'd
      much to get a dish. <br /> <br />He cast his line, and watch'd his float,
      <br />Slow gliding down the tide; <br />He saw it sink! he drew it up, <br />And
      lo! a fish he spied. <br /> <br />He took the struggling gudgeon off, <br />And
      cried&mdash;"I likes his looks, <br />I wish he'd live&mdash;but fishes die
      <br />Soon as they're&mdash;off the hooks!" <br /> <br />At last a dozen more
      he drew&mdash; <br />(Fine-drawing 'twas to him!) <br />But day past by&mdash;and
      twilight came, <br />All objects soon grew dim. <br /> <br />"One more!" he
      cried, "and then I'll pack, <br />And homeward trot to sup,"&mdash; <br />But
      as he spoke, he heard a tread, <br />Which caused him to look up. <br />
      <br />Poor Timmins trembled as he gazed <br />Upon the stranger's face;
      <br />For cut purse! robber! all too plain, <br />His eye could therein
      trace. <br /> <br />"Them's werry handsome boots o' yourn," <br />The ruffian
      smiling cried, <br />"Jist draw your trotters out&mdash;my pal&mdash; <br />And
      we'll swop tiles, besides." <br /> <br />"That coat too, is a pretty fit&mdash;
      <br />Don't tremble so&mdash;for I <br />Von't rob you of a single fish,
      <br />I've other fish to fry." <br /> <br />Poor Timmins was obliged to yield
      <br />Hat, coat, and boots&mdash;in short <br />He was completely stripp'd&mdash;and
      paid <br />Most dearly for his "sport." <br /> <br />And as he homeward went,
      he sigh'd&mdash; <br />"Farewell to stream and brook; <br />O! yes, they'll
      catch me there again <br />A fishing&mdash;with a hook!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Nobbs, "Oh! this is fine!" <br />And feeling sure 'twould answer well,
      <br />He dropp'd the stream a line. <br /> <br />"We cannot find a fitter
      place, <br />If twenty miles we march; <br />Its very look has fix'd my
      choice, <br />So knowing and&mdash;so arch!" <br /> <br />He baited and he
      cast his line, <br />When soon, to his delight, <br />He saw his float bob
      up and down, <br />And lo! he had a bite! <br /> <br />"A gudgeon, Tom, I
      think it is!" <br />Cried Nobbs, "Here, take the prize; <br />It weighs a
      pound&mdash;in its own scales, <br />I'm quite sure by its size." <br />
      <br />He cast again his baited hook, <br />And drew another up! <br />And
      cried, "We are in luck to-day, <br />How glorious we shall sup!" <br />
      <br />All in the basket Tommy stow'd <br />The piscatory spoil; <br />Says
      Nobbs, "We've netted two at least, <br />Albeit we've no toil." <br /> <br />Amazed
      at his own luck, he threw <br />The tempting bait again, <br />And presently
      a nibble had&mdash; <br />A bite! he pull'd amain! <br /> <br />His rod
      beneath the fish's weight <br />Now bent just like a bow, <br />"What's
      this?" cried Nobbs; his son replied, <br />"A salmon, 'tis, I know." <br />
      <br />And sure enough a monstrous perch, <br />Of six or seven pounds, <br />He
      from the water drew, whose bulk <br />Both dad and son confounds. <br />
      <br />"O! Gemini!" he said, when he <br />"O! Pisces!" should have cried;
      <br />And tremblingly the wriggling fish <br />Haul'd to the bridge's side.
      <br /> <br />When, lo! just as he stretched his hand <br />To grasp the
      perch's fin, <br />The slender line was snapp'd in twain, <br />The perch
      went tumbling in! <br /> <br /> "Gone! gone! by gosh!" scream'd Nobbs, while
      Tom <br />Too eager forward bent, <br />And, with a kick, their basket quick
      <br />Into the river sent. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      Those wags who are so fond of playing off their jokes upon others, require
      great skill and foresight to prevent the laugh being turned against
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Smith was an inveterate joker, and his jokes were, for the most part,
      of the practical kind. He had a valuable tortoiseshell cat, whose beauty
      was not only the theme of praise with all the old maids in the
      neighbourhood, but her charms attracted the notice of numerous feline
      gentlemen dwelling in the vicinity, who were, nocturnally, wont to pay
      their devoirs by that species of serenades, known under the cacophonous
      name of caterwauling.
    </p>
    <p>
      One very ugly Tom, (who, it was whispered abroad, was a great-grandfather,
      and scandalously notorious for gallantries unbecoming a cat of his age)
      was particularly obnoxious to our hero; and, in an unlucky moment, he
      resolved to 'pickle him,' as he facetiously termed it. Now his process of
      pickling consisted in mixing a portion of prussic acid in milk. Taking the
      precaution to call in his own pet and favorite, he placed the potion in
      the accustomed path of her long-whiskered suitor. Tom finding the coast
      clear slipped his furry body over the wall, and dropped gently as a lady's
      glove into the garden, and slily smelling the flower-borders, as if he
      were merely amusing himself in the elegant study of botany, stealthily
      approached the house, and uttering a low plaintive 'miau,' to attract the
      attention of his dear Minx, patiently awaited the appearance of his
      true-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minx heard the voice she loved so well, and hurried to meet her ancient
      beau. A slight noise, however, alarmed his timidity, and he scaled the
      wall in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the screams of the maid assured him that 'something had taken
      place;' and when he heard the words, "Oh! the cat! the cat!" he felt quite
      certain that the potion had taken effect. He walked deliberately down
      stairs, and behold! there lay Miss Minx, his own favorite, struggling in
      the agonies of death, on the parlor rug. The fact is, he had shut the
      doors, but forgotten that the window was open, and the consequence was,
      the loss of poor Minx, who had drunk deep of the malignant poison designed
      for her gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was only one of a thousand tricks that had miscarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having one day ascertained that his acquaintance, Tom Wilkins, was gone
      out 'a-shooting,' he determined to way-lay him on his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful moonlight night in the latter end of October.
      Disguising himself in a demoniac mask, a pair of huge wings, and a forked
      tail, he seated himself on a stile in the sportsman's path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon he espied the weary and unconscious Tom approaching, lost in the
      profundity of thought, and though not in love, ruminating on every miss he
      had made in that day's bootless trudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost, touched the stile before his affrighted gaze encountered this
      'goblin damned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His short crop bristled up, assuming the stiffness of a penetrating hair
      brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant his whole frame appeared petrified, and the tide and
      current of his life frozen up in thick-ribbed ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Smith, meanwhile, holding out a white packet at arm's length,
      exclaimed in a sepulchral tone,
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'ye want a pound of magic shot?" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      AWFULLY ponderous as the words struck upon the tightened drum of Tom's
      auriculars, they still tended to arouse his fainting spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mer-mer-mercy on us!" ejaculated he, and shrank back a pace or two, still
      keeping his dilating optics fixed upon the horrible spectre.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'ye want a pound of magic shot?" repeated Jim Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mur-mur-der!" screamed Tom; and, mechanically raising his gun for action
      of some kind appeared absolutely necessary to keep life within him, he
      aimed at the Tempter, trembling in every joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim, who had as usual never calculated upon such a turning of the tables,
      threw off his head&mdash;his assumed one, of course, and, leaping from the
      stile, cried aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Tom, don't shoot&mdash;don't shoot!&mdash;it's only me&mdash;Jim
      Smith!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Down dropped the gun from the sportsman's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you fool! you&mdash;you&mdash;considerable fool!" cried he,
      supporting himself on a neighbouring hawthorn, which very kindly and
      considerately lent him an arm on the occasion. "It's a great mercy&mdash;a
      very great mercy, Jim&mdash;as we wasn't both killed!&mdash;another
      minute, only another minute, and&mdash;but it won't bear thinking on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Tom," said the penitent joker; "I never was so near a corpse
      afore. If I didn't think the shots were clean through me, and that's
      flat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sich jokes," said Tom, "is onpardonable, and you must be mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess I'm out of my head, Tom," said Jim, who was dangling the huge
      mask in his hand, and fast recovering from the effects of his fright.
      "Depend on it, I won't put myself in such a perdicament again, Tom. No, no&mdash;no
      more playing the devil; for, egad! you had liked to have played the devil
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A joke's a joke," sagely remarked Tom, picking up his hat and fowling
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" replied Smith; "but, I think, after all, I had the greatest cause
      for being in a fright. You had the best chance, at any rate; for I could
      not have harmed you, whereas you might have made a riddle of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, there!" answered Tom; "I can tell you, you had as little cause for
      fear as I had, you come to that; for the truth is, the deuce a bit of
      powder or shot either was there in the piece!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say so!" said Jim, evidently disappointed and chop-fallen at
      this discovery of his groundless fears. "Well, I only wish I'd known it,
      that's all!"&mdash;then, cogitating inwardly for a minute, he continued&mdash;"but,
      I say, Tom, you won't mention this little fright of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I'll mention the great fright&mdash;of Jim Smith&mdash;rely upon
      it," said Tom, firmly; and he kept his word so faithfully, that the next
      day the whole story was circulated, with many ingenious additions, to the
      great annoyance of the practical joker. <br /><br /><br /><br />

      "VARIETY," as Cowper says, "is the very spice of life"&mdash;and
      certainly, at Margate, there is enough, in all conscience, to delight the
      most fastidious of pleasure-hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There sailors ply for passengers for a trip in their pleasure boats,
      setting forth all the tempting delights of a fine breeze&mdash;and
      woe-betide the unfortunate cockney who gets in the clutches of a pair of
      plyers of this sort, for he becomes as fixed as if he were actually in a
      vice, frequently making a virtue of necessity, and stepping on board, when
      he had much better stroll on land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away he goes, on the wings of the wind, like&mdash;a gull! Should he be a
      knave, it may probably be of infinite service to society, for he is likely
      ever afterwards to forswear craft of any kind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Donkies too abound, as they do in most watering placesand, oh! what a many
      asses have we seen mounted, trotting along the beach and cliffs!
    </p>
    <p>
      The insinuating address of the boatmen is, however, irresistible; and if
      they cannot induce you to make a sail to catch the wind, they will set
      forth, in all the glowing colors of a dying dolphin, the pleasurable sport
      of catching fish!
    </p>
    <p>
      They tell you of a gentleman, who, "the other day, pulled up, in a single
      hour, I don't know how many fish, weighing I don't know how much." And
      thus baited, some unwise gentleman unfortunately nibbles, and he is
      caught. A bargain is struck, 'the boat is on the shore,' the lines and
      hooks are displayed, and the victim steps in, scarcely conscious of what
      he is about, but full well knowing that he is going to sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      They put out to sea, and casting their baited hooks, the experienced
      fisherman soon pulls up a fine lively whiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ecod!" exclaims the cockney, with dilated optics, "this is fine&mdash;why
      that 'ere fish is worth a matter of a shilling in London&mdash;Do tell me
      how you cotched him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a hook!" replied the boatman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure you did&mdash;but why did'nt he bite mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cause he came t'other side, I s'pose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, let me try that side then," cries the tyro, and carefully changes
      his position.&mdash;"Dear me, this here boat o'yourn wobbles about
      rayther, mister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, sir, at all; it's only the motion of the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like it, tho'; I can tell you, it makes me feel all over
      somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will go off, sir, in time; there's another," and he pulls in another
      wriggling fish, and casts him at the bottom of the boat. "Well, that's
      plaguey tiresome, any how&mdash;two! and I've cotched nothin' yet&mdash;how
      do you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so&mdash;throw in your hook, and bide a bit&mdash;and you'll be
      sure, sir, to feel when there's any thing on your hook; don't you feel any
      thing yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, I feels werry unwell!" cries the landsman; and, bringing up his
      hook and bait, requests the good-natured boatman to pull for shore, 'like
      vinkin,'&mdash;which request; the obliging fellow immediately complies
      with, having agreeably fished at the expense of his fare; and, landing his
      whitings and the flat, laughs in his sleeve at the qualms of his customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is always an abundant crop of such fools as he, who pretend to
      dabble in a science, in utter ignorance of the elements; while, like Jason
      of old, the wily boatman finds a sheep with a golden fleece,&mdash;
      although his brains are always too much on the alert to be what is
      technically termed&mdash;wool-gathering. Some people are desirous of
      seeing every thing; and many landsmen have yet to learn, that they may see
      a deal, without being a-board! <br /><br /><br /><br />

      THERE is certainly no style of writing requiring so much modest assurance
      as autobiography; a position which, I am confident, neither Lord Cherbury,
      nor Vidocq, or any other mortal blessed with an equal developement of the
      organ of self-esteem, can or could deny.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOME, ("sweet home,")&mdash;in his Douglas&mdash;gives, perhaps, one of
      the most concise and concentrated specimens extant, of this species of
      composition. With what an imposing air does his youthful hero blow his own
      trumpet in those well-known lines, commencing,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Norval."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a mere cock-boat in comparison with these first-rates, I think I
      may safely follow in their wake. Should the critics, however, condescend
      to carp at me for likening myself to a cock-boat, I have no objection, if
      by a twist of their ingenuity, they can prove me to be a little funny!
    </p>
    <p>
      Economy was one of the most prominent characteristics of the family from
      which I sprang. Now, some authors would weary their indulgent readers with
      a flatulent chapter upon the moral beauty of this virtue; but as my first
      wish is to win favor by my candor, I must honestly confess, that necessity
      was the parent of this lean attenuated offspring!&mdash;For, alas!
    </p>
    <p>
      My 'angel mother,' (as Anna Maria phrases it,) was a woman of ten
      thousand, for she dwelt in one of the most populous districts of London!
      My sire, was of the most noble order of St. Crispin; and though he had
      many faults, was continually mending&mdash;being the most eminent cobbler
      in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the outset of their connubial partnership, they started under the
      most favorable auspices&mdash;for, whereas other couples marry for love or
      money, they got married for 'nothing' taking advantage of the annual
      gratuitous splicings performed at Shoreditch Church on one sunshiny Easter
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than three years my amiable mother presented her lord and master
      with as many interesting pledges of their affection&mdash;I was the
      cobbler's last&mdash;and
    </p>

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;Our Lodging.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      OUR precarious means were too small to permit us to rent a house, we
      therefore rented one large room, which served us for&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parlor and kitchen and all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      in the uppermost story of a house, containing about a dozen families.
    </p>
    <p>
      This 'airy' apartment was situated in a narrow alley of great
      thoroughfare, in the heart of the great metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower part of this domicile was occupied by one James, who did
      'porter's work,' while his wife superintended the trade of a miscellaneous
      store, called a green-grocer's; although the stock comprised, besides a
      respectable skew of cabbages, carrots, lettuces, and other things in
      season, a barrel of small beer, a side of bacon, a few red herrings, a
      black looking can of 'new milk,' and those less perishable articles,
      Warren's blacking, and Flanders' bricks; while the window was graced with
      a few samples of common confectionary, celebrated under the sweet names of
      lollypops, Buonaparte's ribs, and bulls'-eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one pane, by permission, was placed the sign board of my honored
      parent, informing the reading public, that
    </p>
    <p>
      'Repairs were neatly executed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In my mind's eye how distinctly do I behold that humble shop in all the
      greenness and beauty of its Saturday morning's display.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can I ever forget the kind dumpy motherly Mrs. James, who so often
      patted my curly head, and presented me with a welcome slice of bread and
      butter and a drink of milk, invariably repeating in her homely phrase, "a
      child and a chicken is al'ays a pickin'"&mdash;and declaring her belief,
      that the 'brat' got scarcely enough to "keep life and soul together"&mdash;the
      real truth of which my craving stomach inwardly testified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk of the charities of the wealthy, they are as 'airy nothings' in the
      scale, compared with the unostentatious sympathy of the poor! The former
      only give a portion of their excess, while the latter willingly divide
      their humble crust with a fellow sufferer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agreeable routine of breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper, was unknown
      in our frugal establishment; if we obtained one good meal a day, under any
      name, we were truly thankful.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give some idea of our straitened circumstances, I must relate one
      solitary instance of display on the maternal side. It was on a Saturday
      night, the air and our appetites were equally keen, when my sire, having
      unexpectedly touched a small sum, brought home a couple of pound of real
      Epping. A scream of delight welcomed the savory morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire was kindled, and the meat was presently hissing in the borrowed
      frying-pan of our landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was already in bed, when the unusual sound and savor awoke me. I rolled
      out in a twinkling, and squatting on the floor, watched the culinary
      operations with greedy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom," said my mother, addressing her spouse, "set open the door and
      vinder, and let the neighbors smell ve has something respectable for
      once." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      ARMED with the authority and example of loyalty, for even that renowned

    <p>
      "His pipe and his glass"
    </p>
    <p>
      and induced by the poetical strains of many a bard, from the classic
      Anacreon to those of more modern times, who have celebrated the virtue of
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wine, mighty wine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      it is not to be marvelled at, that men's minds have fallen victims to the
      fascinations of the juice of the purple grape, or yielded to the alluring
      temptations of the 'evil spirit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a lamentable truth, that notwithstanding the laudable and wholesome
      exertions and admonitions of the Temperance and Tee-total Societies, that
      the people of the United Kingdom are grievously addicted to an excessive
      imbibation of spirituous liquors, cordials, and compounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although six-bottle men are now regarded as monstrosities, and drinking
      parties are nearly exploded, tippling and dram-drinking among the lower
      orders are perhaps more indulged in than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gilded and gorgeous temples&mdash;devoted to the worship of the
      reeling-goddess GENEVA&mdash;blaze forth in every quarter of the vast
      metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it matter of wonder, then, that while men of superior intellect and
      education are still weak enough to seek excitement in vinous potations,
      that the vulgar, poor, and destitute, should endeavour to drown their
      sorrows by swallowing the liquid fires displayed under various names, by
      the wily priests of Silenus!
    </p>
    <p>
      That such a deduction is illogical we are well aware, but great examples
      are plausible excuses to little minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both my parents were naturally inclined to sobriety; but, unfortunately,
      and as it too frequently happens, in low and crowded neighbourhoods,
      drunkenness is as contagious as the small-pox, or any other destructive
      malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it chanced that in the first-floor of the house in which we dwelt,
      there also resided one Stubbs and his wife. They had neither chick nor
      child. Stubbs was a tailor by trade, and being a first-rate workman,
      earned weekly a considerable sum; but, like too many of his fraternity, he
      was seldom sober from Saturday night until Wednesday morning. His loving
      spouse 'rowed in the same boat'&mdash;and the 'little green-bottle' was
      dispatched several times during the days of their Saturnalia, to be
      replenished at the never-failing fountain of the 'Shepherd and Flock.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, in one of her maudlin fits, Mrs. Stubbs took a particular fancy
      to my mother; and one day, in the absence of the 'ninth,' beckoned my
      unsuspecting parent into her sittingroom,&mdash;and after gratuitously
      imparting to her the hum-drum history of her domestic squabbles, invited
      her to take a 'drop o' summat'&mdash;to keep up her I sperrits.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! this was the first step&mdash;and she went on, and on, and on, until
      that which at first she loathed became no longer disagreeable, and by
      degrees grew into a craving that was irresistible;&mdash;and, at last, she
      regularly hob-and-nobb'd' with the disconsolate rib of Stubbs, and shared
      alike in all her troubles and her liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fain would I draw a veil over this frailty of my unfortunate parent; but,
      being conscious that veracity is the very soul and essence of history, I
      feel myself imperatively called upon neither to disguise nor to cancel the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father remonstrated in vain-the passion had already taken too deep a
      hold; and one day he was suddenly summoned from his work with the
      startling information, that 'Mother Mullins'&mdash;(so the kind neighbour
      phrased it) was sitting on the step of a public house, in the suburbs,
      completely 'tosticated.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed out, and found the tale too true. A bricklayer in the
      neighbourhood proposed the loan of his barrow, for the poor senseless
      creature could not walk a step. Placing her in the one-wheel-carriage, he
      made the best of his way home, amid the jeers of the multitude. Moorfields
      was then only partially covered with houses; and as he passed a deep
      hollow, on the side of which was placed a notice, intimating that
    </p>
    <h3>
      "RUBBISH MAY BE SHOT HERE!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      his eyes caught the words, and in the bitterness of his heart he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wou'dn't like to shoot her exactly; but I've a blessed mind to turn her
      out!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      IN the vicinity of our alley were numerous horse-rides, and my chief
      delight was being entrusted with a horse, and galloping up and down the
      straw-littered avenue.&mdash;I was about twelve years of age, and what was
      termed a sharp lad, and I soon became a great favourite with the ostlers,
      who admired the aptness with which I acquired the language of the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many stock-brokers who put up at the ride; among others was Mr.
      Timmis&mdash;familiarly called long Jim Timmis. He was a bold, dashing,
      good-humoured, vulgar man, who was quite at home with the ostlers,
      generally conversing with them in their favourite lingo.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had frequent opportunities of shewing him civilities, handing him his
      whip, and holding his stirrup, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he came to the ride in a most amiable and condescending humour,
      and for the first time deigned to address me&mdash;"Whose kid are you?"
      demanded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father's, sir," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know your father, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wise child this;" and he winked at the ostler, who, of course, laughed
      incontinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a-lad," continued he; "what do you say&mdash;would you like to
      serve me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could get any thing by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D-me, if that a'int blunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; that's what I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mean! mean what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could get any blunt, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon he laughed outright, at what he considered my readiness, although
      I merely used the cant term for "money," to which I was most accustomed,
      from my education among the schoolmasters of the ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, take my card," said he; "and tell the old codger, your father, to
      bring you to my office to-morrow morning, at eleven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, blow me," exclaimed my friend the ostler, "if your fortin' arn't
      made; I shall see you a tip-top sawyer&mdash;may I never touch another
      tanner! Vy, I remembers Jim Timmis hisself vos nothin but a grubby boy&mdash;Mother
      Timmis the washer-woman's son, here in what-d've-call-'em-court&mdash;ven
      he vent to old Jarvis fust. He's a prime feller tho', and no mistake&mdash;and
      thof he's no gentleman born, he pays like one, and vot's the difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, punctual to the hour, I waited at his office, which was
      in a large building adjoining the Stock Exchange, as full as a dove-cot,
      with gentlemen of the same feather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O!" said he, eyeing my parent, "and you're this chap's father, are you?
      What are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A boot and shoe-maker, sir; and my Andrew is an honest lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the matter o' that, there's little he can prig here;" replied my
      elegant and intended master. "But his tongs&mdash;eh&mdash;old fellow&mdash;can't
      you rig him out a little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      My father pleaded poverty; and at last he bargained to advance a guinea,
      and deduct it out of my weekly-wages of two and sixpence, and no board. My
      father was glad to make any terms, and the affair was consequently soon
      arranged. I was quickly fitted out, and the next morning attended his
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had, however, little else to do than wait in his office, and run to the
      Stock Exchange, to summon him when a customer dropped in. I had much
      leisure, which I trust was not wholly thrown away, for I practised writing
      on the back of the stock-receipts, of which a quantity hung up in the
      office, and read all the books I could lay my hands on; although, I must
      confess, the chief portion of my knowledge of the world has been derived
      from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The proper study of mankind is man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although quick in temper, and rude in speech and manners, Timmis was kind;
      and, if he had a failing, it was the ambition of being a patron; and he
      was certainly not one of those who do a good deed, and
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blush to find it fame."
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only employed my father to make his boots, but recommended him to
      all his friends as a "good-fit," and procured the old man some excellent
      customers. Among his acquaintance, for he had few friends, was Tom Wallis,
      a fat, facetious man, about forty, with whom he was always lunching and
      cracking his jokes. One day, when the stocks were "shut" and business was
      slack, they started together on a sporting excursion towards the romantic
      region of Hornsey-wood, on which occasion I had the honour of carrying a
      well-filled basket of provisions, and the inward satisfaction of making a
      good dinner from the remnants.
    </p>
    <p>
      They killed nothing but time, yet they were exceedingly merry, especially
      during the discussion of the provisions. Their laughter, indeed, was
      enough to scare all the birds in the neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jim, if you wanted to correct those sheep yonder," said Tom, "what sort
      of tool would you use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ewe-twig, of course," replied my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that's devilish good," said Wallis; "but you ain't hit it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a crown you don't do a better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, a Ram-rod to be sure&mdash;as we're sportsmen."
    </p>
    <p>
      My master agreed that it was more appropriate, and the good-natured Tom
      Wallis flung the crown he had won to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's another," continued he, as Mr. Timmis was just raising a bottle of
      pale sherry to his lips&mdash;"I say, Jim, what birds are we most like
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why swallows, to be sure," quickly replied my patron; who was really, on
      most occasions, a match for his croney in the sublime art of punning, and
      making conundrums, a favourite pastime with the wits of the Stock
      Exchange. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      ON the same landing where Timmis (as he termed it) 'held out,' were five
      or six closets nick-named offices, and three other boys. One was the
      nephew of the before-mentioned Wallis, and a very imp of mischief;
      another, only a boy, with nothing remarkable but his stupidity; while the
      fourth was a scrubby, stunted, fellow, about sixteen or seventeen years of
      age, with a long pale face, deeply pitted with the small-pox, and an
      irregular crop of light hair, most unscientifically cut into tufts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, by reason of his seniority and his gravity, soon became the oracle of
      the party. We usually found him seated on the stairs of the first floor,
      lost in the perusal of some ragged book of the marvellous school&mdash;scraps
      of which he used to read aloud to us, with more unction than propriety,
      indulging rather too much in the note of admiration style; for which he
      soon obtained the name of Old Emphatic!&mdash;But I must confess we did
      obtain a great deal of information from his select reading, and were
      tolerably good listeners too, notwithstanding his peculiar delivery, for
      somehow he appeared to have a permanent cold in his head, which sometimes
      threw a tone of irresistible ridicule into his most pathetic bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bore the scriptural name of Matthew and was, as he informed us, a
      'horphan'&mdash;adding, with a particular pathos, 'without father or
      mother!' His melancholy was, I think, rather attributable to bile than
      destitution, which he superinduced by feeding almost entirely on
      'second-hand pastry,' purchased from the little Jew-boys, who hawk about
      their 'tempting' trash in the vicinity of the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, like other youths of a poetical temperament, from Petrarch down
      to Lord Byron, had a 'passion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I accidentally discovered the object of his platonic flame in the person
      of the little grubby-girl&mdash;the servant of the house-keeper&mdash;for,
      as the proverb truly says,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love and a cough cannot be hid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tender passion first evinced itself in his delicate attentions;&mdash;nor
      was the quick-eyed maid slow to discover her conquest. Her penetration,
      however, was greater than her sympathy. With a tact that would not have
      disgraced a politician&mdash;in a better cause, she adroitly turned the
      swelling current of his love to her own purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the onward flowing stream is made to turn the wheel, while the miller
      sings at the window, so did she avail herself of his strength to do her
      work, while she gaily hummed a time, and sadly 'hummed' poor Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being nearly thirty offices in the building, there were of course in
      winter as many fires, and as many coal-scuttles required. When the eyes of
      the devoted Matthew gazed on the object of his heart's desire toiling up
      the well-stair, he felt he knew not what; and, with a heart palpitating
      with the apprehension that his proffered service might be rejected (poor
      deluded mortal!), he begged he might assist her. With a glance that he
      thought sufficient to ignite the insensible carbon, she accepted his
      offer. Happy Matthew!&mdash;he grasped the handles her warm red-hands had
      touched!&mdash;Cold-blooded, unimaginative beings may deride his
      enthusiasm; but after all, the sentiment he experienced was similar to,
      and quite as pure, as that of Tom Jones, when he fondled Sophia Western's
      little muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas!&mdash;

      Wallis's nephew had several times invited me to pay him a visit at his
      uncle's house, at Crouchend; and so once, during the absence of that
      gentleman who was ruralizing at Tonbridge, I trudged down to his villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing would suit Master John, but that he must 'have out' his uncle's
      gun; and we certainly shot at, and frightened, many sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was just pointing at a fresh quarry, when the loud crow of a cock
      arrested his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Doddington's game 'un, I know," said Master John. "What d'ye think&mdash;if
      he did'nt 'pitch into' our 'dunghill' the other day, and laid him dead at
      a blow. I owe him one!&mdash;Come along." I followed in his footsteps, and
      soon beheld Chanticleer crowing with all the ostentation of a victor at
      the hens he had so ruthlessly widowed. A clothes-horse, with a ragged
      blanket, screened us from his view; and Master'John, putting the muzzle of
      his gun through a hole in this novel ambuscade, discharged its contents
      point blank into the proclaimer of the morn&mdash;and laid him low.
    </p>
    <p>
      I trembled; for I felt that we had committed a 'foul murder.' Master
      Johnny, however, derided my fears&mdash;called it retributive justice&mdash;and
      ignominiously consigned the remains of a game-cock to a dunghill!
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair appeared so like a cowardly assassination, in which I was
      (though unwillingly&mdash;) 'particeps criminis'&mdash;that I walked away
      without partaking of the gooseberry-pie, which he had provided for our
      supper. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      I was early at my post on the following morning, being particularly
      anxious to meet with Mr. Wallis's scapegrace nephew, and ascertain whether
      anybody had found the dead body of the game-cock, and whether an inquest
      had been held; for I knew enough of the world to draw my own conclusions
      as to the result. He, although the principal, being a relative, would get
      off with a lecture, while I should probably be kicked out of my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a fever of expectation, I hung over the banisters of the geometrical
      staircase, watching for his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was thus occupied, my nerves "screwed up,"&mdash;almost to
      cracking, Mr. Wallis's office-door was thrown open, and I beheld that very

      me full in the face. I really lost my equilibrium at the apparition.

      "Oh!&mdash;it's you, is it," cried he. "Where's my rascal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not come yet, sir," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fellow's never at hand when I want him&mdash;I'll cashier him by
      ___." He slammed to his own door, and&mdash;opened it again immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Timmis come?" demanded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; I don't think he'll be here for an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;I'm early in the field; but what brings you here so soon?&mdash;some
      mischief, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm always early, sir, for I live hard by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!&mdash;well&mdash;I wish&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I do anything for you, sir?" I enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that's a good thought," said he, and his countenance assumed its
      usually bland expression. "Let me see&mdash;I want to send my carpet-bag,
      and a message, to my housekeeper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do it, sir, and be back again in no time," cried I, elated at
      having an opportunity of obliging the man whom I had really some cause to
      fear, in the critical situation in which his nephew's thoughtlessness had
      placed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my eagerness, however, and notwithstanding the political acuteness of
      my manoeuvre, I got myself into an awful dilemma. Having received the bag,
      and his message, I walked off, but had scarcely descended a dozen stairs
      when he recalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where the devil are you going?" cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To your house, sir," I innocently replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, do you know it, then?" demanded he in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a position. It was a miracle that I did not roll over the
      carpet-bag and break my neck, in the confusion of ideas engendered by this
      simple query.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not lie, and evasion was not my forte. A man or boy in the wrong
      can never express himself with propriety; an opinion in which Quinctilian
      also appears to coincide, when he asserts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orator perfectus nisi vir bonus esse non potest."
    </p>
    <p>
      I therefore summoned up sufficient breath and courage to answer him in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when, pray, were you there?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday, sir, your nephew asked me to come and see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The impudent little blackguard?" cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you ain't angry, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angry with you?&mdash;no, my lad; you're an active little chap, and I
      wish that imp of mine would take a pattern by you. Trot along, and mind
      you have 'a lift' both ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      Off I went, as light as a balloon when the ropes are cut.
    </p>
    <p>
      I executed my commission with dispatch, and completely won the favour of
      Mr. Wallis, by returning the money which he had given me for coach-hire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's this?&mdash;you didn't tramp, did you?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I rode both ways," I replied; "but I knew the coachmen, and they
      gave me a cast for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Umph!&mdash;well, that's quite proper&mdash;quite proper," said he,
      considering a moment. "Honesty's the best policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father always told me so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father's right;&mdash;there's half-a-crown for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I was delighted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum;"
    </p>
    <p>
      and I felt the truth of this line of Dr. Johnson's, although I was then
      ignorant of it. I met his nephew on the landing, but my fears had
      vanished. We talked, however, of the departed bird, and he wished me, in
      the event of discovery, to declare that I had loaded and carried the gun,
      and that he would bear the rest of the blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, strongly reminded me of the two Irish smugglers:&mdash;one
      had a wooden leg, and carried the cask; while his comrade, who had the use
      of both his pins, bore him upon his shoulders, and, complaining of the
      weight, the other replied:&mdash;"Och! thin, Paddy, what's the
      bothuration; if you carry me, don't I carry the whiskey, sure, and that's
      fair and aqual!" and I at once declined any such Hibernian partnership in
      the affair, quite resolved that he should bear the whole onus upon his own
      shoulders. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      I soon discovered that my conduct had been reported in the most favourable
      colours to Mr. Timmis, and the consequence was that he began to take more
      notice of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew, what sort of a fist can you write?" demanded he. I shewed him
      some caligraphic specimens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D___ me, if your y's and your g's hav'nt tails like skippingropes. We
      must have a little topping and tailing here, and I think you'll do. Here,
      make out this account, and enter it in the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left me to do his bidding; and when he returned from the
      Stock-Exchange, inspected the performance, which I had executed with
      perspiring ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I watched his countenance. "That'll do&mdash;you're a brick! I'll make a
      man of you&mdash;d___ me."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day forward I had the honour of keeping his books, and making
      out the accounts. I was already a person of importance, and certainly some
      steps above the boys on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not, however, obtain any advance in my weekly wages; but on
      "good-days" got a douceur, varying from half a crown to half a sovereign!
      and looked upon myself as a made man. Most of the receipts went to my
      father; whatever he returned to me I spent at a neighbouring book-stall,
      and in the course of twelve months I possessed a library of most amusing
      and instructive literature,&mdash;Heaven knows! of a most miscellaneous
      character, for I had no one to guide me in the selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Mr. Timmis's numerous clients, was one Mr. Cornelius Crobble, a man
      of most extraordinary dimensions; he was also a "chum" of, and frequently
      made one of a party with, his friend Mr. Wallis, and other croneys, to
      white-bait dinners at Blackwall, and other intellectual banquets. In fact,
      he seldom made his appearance at the office, but the visit ended in an
      engagement to dine at some "crack-house" or other. The cost of the "feed,"
      as Mr. Timmis termed it, was generally decided by a toss of "best two and
      three;" and somehow it invariably happened that Mr. Crobble lost; but he
      was so good-humoured, that really it was a pleasure, as Mr. Wallis said,
      to "grub" at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      They nick-named him Maximo Rotundo&mdash;and he well deserved the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Timmis?" said he, one day after he had taken a seat, and puffed
      and blowed for the space of five minutes&mdash;"Cuss them stairs; they'll
      be the death o' me."
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran to summon my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, old fellow?" demanded Mr. Timmis; "tip us your fin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queer!" replied Mr. Crobble,&mdash;tapping his breast gently with his fat
      fist, and puffing out his cheeks&mdash;to indicate that his lungs were
      disordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, bellows to mend?" cried my accomplished patron&mdash;"D___ me,
      never say die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just come from Doctor Sprawles: says I must take exercise; no malt liquor&mdash;nothing
      at breakfast&mdash;no lunch&mdash;no supper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you'll be a skeleton&mdash;a transfer from the consolidated to the
      reduced in no time," exclaimed Mr. Timmis; and his friend joined in the
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a-thinking, Timmis&mdash;don't you belong to a cricketclub?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"Of joining you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the ticket," cried Timmis&mdash;"consider yourself elected; I can
      carry any thing there. I'm quite the cock of the walk, and no mistake.
      Next Thursday's a field-day&mdash;I'll introduce you. Lord! you'll soon be
      right as a trivet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wallis was summoned, and the affair was soon arranged; and I had the
      gratification of being present at Mr. Crobble's inauguration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a broiling day, and there was a full field; but he conducted
      himself manfully, notwithstanding the jokes of the club. He batted
      exceedingly well, "considering," as Mr. Wallis remarked; but as for the
      "runs," he was completely at fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only attempted it once; but before he had advanced a yard or two, the
      ball was caught; and the agile player, striking the wicket with ease,
      exclaimed, amid the laughter of the spectators&mdash;"Out! so don't
      fatigue yourself, I beg, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the match was concluded, amid cheers and shouting, in which the
      rotund, good-natured novice joined most heartily. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      Two days after the cricket-match, Mr. Crobble paid a visit to my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, old fellow, d___ me me, if you ain't a trump&mdash;how's your
      wind?"&mdash;kindly enquired Mr. Timmis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vastly better, thank'ye; how's Wallis and the other fellows?&mdash;prime
      sport that cricketing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but, I say, you'll never have 'a run' of luck, if you stick to the
      wicket so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but I made a hit or two, you must allow," replied Mr. Crobble;
      "though I'm afraid I'm a sorry member."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A member, indeed!&mdash;no, no; you're the body, and we're the&mdash;members,"
      replied Mr. Timmis, laughing; "but, halloo! what's that patch on your
      forehead&mdash;bin a fighting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I've been a hunting," said Mr. Crobble, "and this here's the
      fruits&mdash;You know my gray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nag you swopp'd the bay roadster for with Tom Brown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him," answered Crobble. "Well, I took him to Hertfordshire Wednesday last&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took you, you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's the odds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The odds, why, in your favour, to be sure, as I dare say the horse can
      witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, howsomever, there was a good field&mdash;and off we went. The level
      country was all prime; but he took a hedge, and nearly julked all the life
      out o' me. I lost my stirrup, and should have lost my seat, had'nt I
      clutched his mane&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And kept your seat by main force?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, away we went, like Johnny Gilpin. Hunting may be sport, says I, but
      I'm blest if its pleasure. This infernal horse was always fond of shying,
      and now he's going to shy me off; and, ecod! no sooner said than done.
      Over his head I go, like a rocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a foot-ball, you mean," interrupted Mr. Timmis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, as luck would have it, tumbles into a ditch, plump with my head agin
      the bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By jingo! such a 'run' upon the bank was enough to break it," cried my
      master, whose propensity to crack a joke overcame all feeling of sympathy
      for his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It broke my head though; and warn't I in a precious mess&mdash;that's all&mdash;up
      to my neck, and no mistake&mdash;and black as a chimney-sweep&mdash;such
      mud!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And only think of a man of your property investing his substance in mud!
      That is a good 'un!&mdash;Andrew," said he, "tell Wally to come here." I
      summoned his crony, and sat myself down to the books, to enjoy the
      sportive sallies of the two friends, who roasted the 'fat buck,' their
      loving companion, most unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sly old badger," cried Wallis, "why, you must have picked out the
      ditch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but they picked out me, and a precious figure I cut&mdash;I can tell
      you&mdash;I was dripping from top to toe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very like dripping, indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Timmis, eyeing his fat friend,
      and bursting into an immoderate fit of laughter. The meeting ended, as
      usual, with a bet for a dinner at the "Plough" for themselves and their
      friends, which Mr. Crobble lost&mdash;as usual. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      STEAM-BOATS did not run to Greenwich and Blackwall at this period; and
      those who resorted to the white-bait establishments at those places,
      either availed themselves of a coach or a boat. Being now transformed, by
      a little personal merit, and a great favour, from a full-grown errand-boy
      to a small clerk, Mr. Timmis, at the suggestion of my good friend Mr.
      Wallis, offered me, as a treat, a row in the boat they had engaged for the
      occasion; which, as a matter of course, I did not refuse: making myself as
      spruce as my limited wardrobe would permit, I trotted at their heels to
      the foot of London-bridge, the point of embarkation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party, including the boatman, consisted of eight souls; the tide was
      in our favour, and away we went, as merry a company as ever floated on the
      bosom of Father Thames. Mr. Crobble was the chief mark for all their
      sallies, and indeed he really appeared, from his size, to have been
      intended by Nature for a "butt," as Mr. Wallis wickedly remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told, me, Crobble, of your hunting exploit in Hertfordshire," said
      Mr. Wallis; "I'll tell you something as bangs that hollow; I'm sure I
      thought I should have split with laughter when I heard of it. You know the
      old frump, my Aunt Betty, Timmis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure&mdash;she with the ten thousand in the threes," replied Mr.
      Timmis; "a worthy creature; and I'm sure you admire her principal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I," cried Wallis; and he winked significantly at his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what d'ye think; she, and Miss Scragg, her toady, were in the
      country t'other day, and must needs amuse themselves in an airing upon a
      couple of prads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; they were cantering along&mdash;doing the handsome&mdash;and had
      just come to the border of a pond, when a donkey pops his innocent nose
      over a fence in their rear, and began to heehaw' in a most melodious
      strain. The nags pricked up their ears in a twinkling, and made no more
      ado but bolted. Poor aunty tugged! but all in vain; her bay-cob ran into
      the water; and she lost both her presence of mind and her seat, and
      plumped swash into the pond&mdash;her riding habit spreading out into a
      beautiful circle&mdash;while she lay squalling and bawling out in the
      centre, like a little piece of beef in the middle of a large
      batter-pudding! Miss Scragg, meanwhile, stuck to her graymare, and went
      bumping along to the admiration of all beholders, and was soon out of
      sight: luckily a joskin, who witnessed my dear aunt's immersion, ran to
      her assistance, and, with the help of his pitch-fork, safely landed her;
      for unfortunately the pond was not above three or four feet deep! and so
      she missed the chance of being an angel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you the transfer of her threes!&mdash;what a pity!" said the
      sympathizing Mr. Timmis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I heard of the accident, of course, as in duty bound, I wrote an
      anxious letter of affectionate enquiry and condolence. At the same period,
      seeing an advertisement in the Times&mdash;'To be sold, warranted sound, a
      gray-mare, very fast, and carries a lady; likewise a bay-cob, quiet to
      ride or drive, and has carried a lady'&mdash;I was so tickled with the
      co-incidence, that I cut it out, and sent it to her in an envelope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prime! by Jove!"&mdash;shouted Mr. Crobble&mdash;"But, I say, Wallis&mdash;you
      should have sent her a 'duck' too, as a symbolical memorial of her
      accident!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      against 'em. If there's a ditch in the way, he's sure to dare some of his
      companions to leap it, before he overs it himself; if he finds it safe,
      away he springs like a greyhound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly him, I know him," replied Mr. Timmis; "that's what he calls
      learning to shave upon other people's chins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent!" exclaimed Mr. Wallis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a very devil," continued Mr. Crobble; "always proposing some fun or
      other: Pic-nics are his delight; but he always leaves others to bring the
      grub, and brings nothing but himself. I hate Pic-nics, squatting in the
      grass don't suit me at all; when once down, I find it no easy matter to
      get up again, I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon there was a general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talking of Pic-nics," said Mr. Timmis, "reminds me of one that was held
      the other day in a meadow, on the banks of the Lea. The party, consisting
      of ladies only, and a little boy, had just spread out their prog on a
      clean table-cloth, when they were alarmed by the approach of a cow. They
      were presently on their pins, (cow'd, of course,) and sheered off to a
      respectful distance, while the cow walked leisurely over the table-cloth,
      smelling the materials of the feast, and popp'd her cloven foot plump into
      a currant and raspberry pie! and they had a precious deal of trouble to
      draw her off; for, as Tom Davis said, there were some veal-patties there,
      which were, no doubt, made out of one of her calves; and in her maternal
      solicitude, she completely demolished the plates and dishes, leaving the
      affrighted party nothing more than the broken victuals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a lark!" exclaimed Mr. Crobble; "I would have given a guinea to have
      witnessed the fun. That cow was a trojan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A star in the milky way," cried Mr. Wallis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now approached the 'Plough;' and Mr. Crobble having 'satisfied' the
      boatman, Mr. Wallis gave me half-a-crown, and bade me make the best of my
      way home. I pocketed the money, and resolved to 'go on the highway,' and
      trudge on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew," said my worthy patron, "now don't go and make a beast of
      yourself, but walk straight home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew," said Mr. Wallis, imitating his friend's tone of admonition; "if
      any body asks you to treat 'em, bolt; if any body offers to treat you,
      retreat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew," said Mr. Crobble, who was determined to put in his oar, and row
      in the same boat as his friends; "Andrew,"&mdash;"Yes, Sir;" and I touched
      my hat with due respect, while his two friends bent forward to catch his
      words. "Andrew," repeated he, for the third time, "avoid evil
      communication, and get thee gone from Blackwall, as fast as your legs can
      carry you&mdash;for, there's villainous bad company just landed here&mdash;wicked
      enough to spoil even the immaculate Mr. Cornelius Crobble!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    <p>
      I FOUND myself quite in a strange land upon parting with my master and his
      friends. It was war-time, and the place was literally swarming with
      jack-tars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking to the road, for the footway was quite crowded, I soon reached
      Poplar. Here a large mob impeded my progress. They appeared all moved with
      extraordinary merriment. I soon distinguished the objects of their mirth.
      Two sailors, mounted back to back on a cart-horse, were steering for
      Blackwall. A large horse-cloth served them as a substitute for a saddle,
      and the merry fellow behind held the reins; he was smoking a short pipe,
      while his mate was making an observation with his spy-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Starboard, Tom, starboard!" cried the one in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, aye-starboard it is!" replied his companion, tugging at the rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holloo, messmate! where are you bound?" bawled a sailor in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the port o' Blackwall," replied the steersman. "But we're going quite
      in the wind's eye, and I'm afeared we shan't make it to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A queer craft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Werry," replied Tom. "Don't answer the helm at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any grog on board?" demanded the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not enough to wet the boatswain's whistle; for, da'e see, mate, there's
      no room for stowage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shiver my timbers!&mdash;no grog!" exclaimed the other; "why&mdash;you'll
      founder. If you don't splice the main-brace, you'll not make a knot an
      hour. Heave to&mdash;and let's drink success to the voyage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart, mate, for I'm precious krank with tacking. Larboard,
      Tom&mdash;larboard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye, aye&mdash;larboard it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, run her right into that 'ere spirit-shop to leeward, and let's have
      a bowl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom tugged away, and soon "brought up" at the door of a wine-vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go the anchor," exclaimed his messmate&mdash;"that's it&mdash;coil
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, mate&mdash;here's a picter of his royal majesty"&mdash;giving the
      sailor alongside a new guinea&mdash;"and now tell the steward to mix us a
      jorum as stiff as a nor'wester, and, let's all drink the King's health&mdash;God
      bless him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hooray!" shouted the delighted mob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their quondam friend soon did his bidding, bringing out a huge china-bowl
      filled with grog, which was handed round to every soul within reach, and
      presently dispatched;&mdash;two others followed, before they "weighed
      anchor and proceeded on their voyage," cheered by the ragged multitude,
      among whom they lavishly scattered their change; and a most riotous and
      ridiculous scramble it produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was much pleased with the novelty of the scene, and escaped from the
      crowd as quickly as I conveniently could, for I was rather apprehensive of
      an attempt upon my pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      What strange beings are these sailors! They have no care for the morrow,
      but spend lavishly the hard-earned wages of their adventurous life. To one
      like myself, who early knew the value of money, this thoughtless
      extravagance certainly appeared unaccountable, and nearly allied to
      madness; but, when I reflected that they are sometimes imprisoned in a
      ship for years, without touching land, and frequently in peril of losing
      their lives&mdash;that they have scarcely time to scatter their wages and
      prize-money in the short intervals which chance offers them of mixing with
      their fellow-men, my wonder changed to pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man in a ship," says Dr. Johnson, "is worse than a man in a jail; for
      the latter has more room, better food, and commonly better company, and is
      in safety." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      THE love-lorn Matthew had departed, no doubt unable to bear the sight of
      that staircase whose boards no longer resounded with the slip-slap of the
      slippers of that hypocritical beauty, "his Mary." With him, the romance of
      the landing-place, and the squad, had evaporated; and I had no sympathies,
      no pursuits, in common with the remaining "boys"&mdash;my newly-acquired
      post, too, nearly occupied the whole of my time, while my desire of study
      increased with the acquisition of books, in which all my pocket-money was
      expended.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, my good friend, Mr. Wallis, entered the office, followed by a
      short, sharp-visaged man, with a sallow complexion; he was dressed in a
      shabby frock, buttoned up to the throat&mdash;a rusty black silk
      neckerchief supplying the place of shirt and collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood just within the threshold of the door, holding his napless hat in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Wally, my buck," cried my master, extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wallis advanced close to his elbow, and spoke in a whisper; but I
      observed, by the direction of his eyes, that the subject of his
      communication was the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said Mr. Timmis, "it's all very well, Walley&mdash;but I hate all
      forriners;&mdash;why don't he go back to Frogland, and not come here,
      palming himself upon us. It's no go&mdash;not a scuddick. They're all a
      parcel o' humbugs&mdash;and no mistake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered this gracious opinion sufficiently loud to strike upon the
      tympanum of the poor fellow at the door, I could perceive his dark eyes
      glisten, and the blood tinge his woe-begone cheeks; his lips trembled with
      emotion: there was an evident struggle between offended gentility, and
      urgent necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pride, however, gained the mastery; and advancing the right foot, he
      raised his hat, and with peculiar grace bowing to the two friends&mdash;"Pardon,
      Monsieur Vallis," said he, in tremulous accents, "I am 'de trop;' permit,
      me to visdraw"&mdash;and instantly left the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Timmis, startled by his sudden exit, looked at Mr. Wallis for an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By ___!" exclaimed Mr. Wallis seriously&mdash;"you've hurt that poor
      fellow's feelings. I would sooner have given a guinea than he should have
      heard you. Dubois is a gentleman; and altho' he's completely 'stumped,'
      and has'nt a place to put his head in, he's tenacious of that respect
      which is due to every man, whether he happens to be at a premium, or a
      discount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go it!" cried Mr. Timmis, colouring deeply at this merited reproof&mdash;"If
      this ain't a reg'lar sermon! I didn't mean to hurt his feelings, d___ me;
      I'm a reg'lar John Bull, and he should know better than to be popped at my
      bluntness. D___ me, I wouldn't hurt a worm&mdash;you know I wouldn't,
      Wallis."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tone of contrition in this rambling apology that satisfied Mr.
      Wallis of its truth; and he immediately entered into an explanation on the
      Frenchman's situation. He had known him, he said, for several years as a
      tutor in the family of one of his clients, by whom he was much respected:
      a heavy loss had compelled them suddenly to reduce their establishment;
      Dubois had entreated to remain with his pupil&mdash;refused to receive any
      salary&mdash;and had even served his old patron in the capacity of a
      menial, adhering to him in all his misfortunes, and only parted with him,
      reluctantly, at the door of the debtor's prison!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he do that?" said my master; and I saw his eyes moisten at the
      relation. "A French mounseer do that! Game&mdash;d___ me!"&mdash;and
      lifting the lid of his desk, he drew out a five pound note! "Here, Wallis,
      tip him this flimsey! Tell him&mdash;you know what to say&mdash;I'm no
      speechifier&mdash;but you know what I mean." I almost jumped up and hugged
      my master, I was so excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Monsieur Dubois again made his appearance; and Mr. Wallis had
      the pleasure of beholding Mr. Timmis and his gallic friend on the best
      terms imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I had good cause to rejoice; for it was agreed that I should
      take lessons in the "foreign lingo," by way of giving him "a lift," as Mr.
      Timmis expressed it. I remember him with feelings of gratitude; for I owe
      much more than the knowledge of the language to his kindness and
      instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Mr. Timmis, he could never sufficiently appreciate his worth,
      although he uniformly treated him with kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talk of refinement," said he, one day, when discussing Dubois' merits
      with Mr. Wallis; "I saw a bit to-day as bangs everything. A cadger
      sweeping a crossing fell out with a dustman. Wasn't there some spicy jaw
      betwixt 'em. Well, nothing would suit, but the dustman must have a go, and
      pitch into the cadger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "D___ me, what does the cove do, but he outs with a bit of dirty
      pasteboard, and he says, says he, "I sha'nt fight with fistesses, it's
      wulgar!&mdash;but if he's a mind to anything like a gemman, here's my
      card!" Wasn't there a roar! I lugg'd out a bob, and flung it at the
      vagabond for his wit." <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      HAVING to deliver a letter, containing an account and a stock receipt, to
      one of Mr. Timmis's clients, residing at the west end of the town; in
      crossing through one of the fashionable squares, I observed a flat-faced
      negro servant in livery, standing at the door of one of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two chimney sweepers who happened to be passing, showed their white teeth
      in a contemptuous grin at the African.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bob," I overheard one remark, "ar'n't you glad you ain't a black-a-moor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," replied his sooty brother, "they're sich ugly
      warmints. Master's daughter, wots come from boarding school! says the
      sight of 'ems' enough to frighten one into conwulsions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! for the prejudice of the world! How much this ignorant remark
      reminded me of my patron's unfounded hatred of all "forriners." It was
      precisely the same sentiment, differently expressed, that actuated the
      thoughts and opinions of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must, however, do Mr. Timmis the justice to say, that he made ample
      amends to Monsieur Dubois for the affront he had so thoughtlessly put upon
      the worthy Frenchman; and did all in his power to obtain him pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequent change in his dress and manner, his amiable conduct, and
      gentlemanly deportment, at last completely won upon the esteem of the
      boisterous broker, who swore, (for that was generally his elegant manner
      of expressing his sincerity) that Dubois was a 'downright good'un;' and
      were it not for his foreign accent, he should have taken him for an
      Englishman born&mdash;really believing, that there was no virtue in the
      world but of English growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had now been above twelve-months in his office, and although I had
      received but a moderate compensation for my services, yet the vast
      improvement I had made (thanks to the instruction of Monsieur Dubois,) was
      more valuable than gold. My father also, though but scantily furnished
      with book-knowledge, had, nevertheless, the good sense to appreciate and
      encourage my progress; he was well aware, from observation, that
      'knowledge is power,' and would frequently quote the old saw, "When house,
      and land, and money's spent;<br /> Then larning is most excellent"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and spared all the money he could scrape together to purchase books for
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mr. Crobble came into the office with an open letter in his hand.
      "Here,"&mdash;cried he, "I've received a remittance at last from that,
      German fellow&mdash;two good bills on the first house in the city&mdash;but
      I can't make top nor tail of his rigmarole. Do you know any chap among
      your acquaintance who can read German?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," replied Mr. Timmis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you allow me, Mr. Crobble?" said I, stepping forward. "This letter
      is written in French, not German, Sir," I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the difference to me, Master Andrew; it might as well be in wild
      Irish, for the matter o' that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew can read the lingo," said my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil he can!" exclaimed Mr. Crobble; "I dare say I shall be able to
      make it out," said I; "and if not, Monsieur Dubois will be here; to-morrow
      morning, and you can have it by twelve o'clock, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't that the ticket?" exclaimed Mr. Timmis, delighted at the surprise
      of his friend; "you don't know how vastly clever we are, old fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crobble, much gratified at this information, placed the letter in my
      hands; and, leaving me to take a lunch at Garraway's with Mr. Timmis, I
      eagerly sat about my task&mdash;and luckily it was not only plainly
      written, but the subject-matter by no means difficult, being rather
      complimentary than technical. By the time they returned, I had not only
      translated, but made a fair copy of it, in my best hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, that is clever," said Mr. Crobble; "let me see, now, what shall I
      give you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Sir," I promptly replied; "I am Mr. Timmis's clerk&mdash;and all
      that I know I owe to his kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw, with pleasure, that this compliment was not lost upon my master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crobble was really a gentleman in feeling, and therefore did not
      persist in offering me any remuneration; but as he left the office, he
      said, "I thank you, Mr. Andrew&mdash;I shall not forget your services;"
      and departed evidently much pleased with my performance. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      road-side to a Cockney-party in a one-horse chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, can we go forward, then?" demanded the anxious and wearied
      traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noa, ee cawnt, 'cause the roads are under water;" replied the joskin,
      with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly a situation more ridiculous than interesting; and I
      smiled when I heard the story told, little suspecting that Fortune would
      one day throw me into a similar dilemina&mdash;so blindly do we mortals
      hug ourselves in the supposed security of our tact and foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How d'ye do, Mr. Andrew," said Mr. Crobble, when he had seated himself,
      and sufficiently inflated his lungs, after the fatiguing operation of
      mounting the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Timmis?&mdash;tell him I want a word with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      I quickly summoned my patron, and followed him into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, old puff and blow!" exclaimed Mr. Timmis, with his usual
      familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in the wind? Want to sell out? The fives are fallen three per
      cent. since Friday. All the 'Change is as busy as the devil in a high
      wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;no more dabbling, Timmis," replied Mr. Crobble; "I lost a cool
      hundred last account; I want a word in private with you"&mdash;and he
      glanced towards me; upon which I seized my hat, and took up my position at
      my old post on the landing. How were my feelings altered since I first
      loitered there, listening to the marvels of poor Matthew!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was lost in a pleasant reverie, when the sharp voice of Mr. Timmis
      recalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Andrew," said he, "my friend Crobble wants a clerk, and has cast his eye
      upon you. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I scarcely knew what to say. On one side stood my master, to whom I really
      owed so much&mdash;on the other his friend, who offered me a promotion,
      which I felt, on many accounts, was most attractive. "I should have no
      objection," I replied, "but great pleasure in serving Mr. Crobble, sir&mdash;but&mdash;I
      have received so many favours from you, that I'm afraid I might seem
      ungrateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured Mr. Wallis happily stepped in at this moment to my
      relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," replied Mr. Timmis; "the stock is delivered to the highest
      bidder; here Crobble backs eighteen shillings a week against my
      half-a-crown-take him."
    </p>
    <p>
      I still felt some hesitation, although it was evident, from his
      expression, that Mr. Timmis valued the servant much less than the servant
      valued the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only look here, Wally," cried he; "here stands Andrew, like an ass
      between two bundles of hay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather like a bundle of hay between two asses, I think," replied Mr.
      Wallis; and good-naturedly tapping me on the shoulder, he continued&mdash;"accept
      Mr. Crobble's offer, Master Andrew: you're much too good for Timmis&mdash;he
      can soon get a grubby half-crown boy&mdash;but you may wait a long time
      for such an eligible offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eighteen shillings a week," said Mr. Crobble; who, I must confess,
      without any particular stretch of self-esteem, appeared anxious to engage
      me&mdash;, "but I shall want security."
    </p>
    <p>
      That word "security" fell like an avalanche on my mounting spirit, and
      cast me headlong down the imaginary ascent my busy thoughts had climbed
      to!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred pounds," continued Mr. Crobble; "d'ye think&mdash;have you
      any friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, sir; my father is a poor man, and quite unable." I could scarcely
      speak&mdash;like the driver of the one-horse chaise, I could neither
      advance nor recede.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The father," said Mr. Timmis, "is only a poor shoe-maker&mdash;a good
      fellow tho'&mdash;an excellent fit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean to say," cried Mr. Wallis, "it were bootless to seek security of
      the shoe-maker."
    </p>
    <p>
      A laugh ensued; and, notwithstanding my agitated feelings, I could not
      forbear being tickled by Mr. Wallis's humour, and joining in the
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sally gave a most favourable turn to the discussion. "Come," said Mr.
      Wallis, "I'll stand two hundred and fifty&mdash;and you, Timmis, must go
      the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; d___ me, he may bolt with the cash-box, and let me in, perhaps,"
      exclaimed Mr. Timmis. I burst into tears; I felt, that from my long and
      faithful services, I deserved a better opinion&mdash;although I had no
      right to expect so great a favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rude as he was, he felt some compunction at having wounded my feelings;
      and swore a round oath that he was only joking, and I was a fool. "Did I
      think, for a moment, that Wally should get the start of him; no&mdash;I
      was an honest chap, and he'd put his fist to double the amount to serve
      me;" and then bade me "sit to the books," and make all square before I cut
      my stick: and thus happily concluded this most momentous change in my
      circumstances. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      How impatiently did I count the minutes 'till the office was closed, for I
      longed to communicate the glad tidings of my good fortune to my worthy
      father. The old man wept with joy at the prospect, and assisted me in
      rearing those beautiful fabrics termed castles in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own trade, by the recommendation of the rough, ill-mannered, but
      good-natured Mr. Timmis, had wonderfully increased; and, by making some
      temporary sacrifices, he was enabled to give me an appearance more
      suitable to the new position in which I was so unexpectedly placed. In a
      narrow alley, on the south side of the Royal Exchange, on the
      ground-floor, I found the counting-house of Mr. Crobble. Under his
      directions, I quickly made myself master of the details of the business.
      Alas! it was but the slender fragment of a once flourishing mercantile
      house, of which time had gradually lopped off the correspondents, whilst
      his own inertness had not supplied the deficiency by a new connexion; for
      his father had left him such an ample fortune, that he was almost careless
      of the pursuit, although he could not make up his mind, as he said, to
      abandon the "old shop," where his present independence had been
      accumulated. I consequently found plenty of leisure, uninterrupted by the
      continual hurry and bustle of a broker's office, to pursue my favourite
      studies, and went on, not only to the entire satisfaction of Mr. Crobble,
      but to my own, and really began to find myself a man of some importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of business, I one day fell in with an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A parcel for Cornelius Crobble, Esq.," said a little porter, of that
      peculiar stamp which is seen hanging about coach-offices&mdash;"Two
      and-sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the direction, and drew out the "petty cash" to defray the
      demand; when, then, first looking at the man, I thought I recognised his
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried I, "Isn't your name&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matthew," answered he quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matthew!&mdash;why, don't you know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," replied he, staring vacantly at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!&mdash;Have I so outgrown all knowledge? Don't you recollect
      Andrew Mullins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavins!" exclaimed he, with his well-remembered nasal twang; "are
      you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I declare now you've growed into a gentleman. I should'nt&mdash;I
      really should'nt&mdash;" He did not say what he really "should not"&mdash;but
      extended his hand.&mdash;"Hope you ain't too proud to shake hands with an
      old friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I shook him heartily by the hand, and made some enquiries touching his
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Matthew seated himself with all the ease imaginable, and laid his
      knot beside him, and began, after the manner of his favourite heroes, to
      "unbosom himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've a father," said he; "but I'm a horphan, without father nor mother&mdash;a
      houtcast!"&mdash;and he sunk his head upon his bosom; and I observed that
      his scrubby crop was already becoming thin and bald.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I left the place in the 'lane,' I've bin a-going&mdash;down&mdash;down"&mdash;and
      he nearly touched the floor with his hand. "That gal, Mary, was the ruin
      of me&mdash;I shall never forget her.&mdash;My hopes is sunk, like the sun
      in the ocean, never to rise agin!" I was rather amused by this romantic,
      though incorrect, figure; but I let him proceed: "I've got several places,
      but lost 'em all. I think there's a spell upon me; and who can struggle
      against his fate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to console him, and found, upon a further confession, that he had
      flown to spirits "now and then," to blunt the sharp tooth of mental
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, was the chief cause of his want of success, which he blindly
      attributed to fate&mdash;the common failing of all weak minds. For my
      part, notwithstanding the imperial authority of the great Napoleon
      himself, I have no faith in Fate, believing that the effect, whether good
      or bad, may invariably be traced to some cause in the conduct of the
      individual, as certainly as the loss of a man, in a game of draughts, is
      the consequence of a "wrong move" by the player!&mdash;And poor Matthew's
      accusation of Fate put me in mind of the school-boy, who, during a wet
      vacation, rushed vindictively at the barometer, and struck it in the face,
      exclaiming&mdash;"Only three holidays left, and still this plaguey glass
      says 'very wet;'&mdash;I can't bear it&mdash;I can't&mdash;and I won't."
    </p>
    <p>
      I did all in my power to comfort the little porter, exhorting him to
      diligence and sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were always a kind friend," said he, pathetically; "and perhaps&mdash;perhaps
      you will give me something to drink your health, for old-acquaintance
      sake." This unexpected turn compelled me to laughter. I gave him sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Matthew, I found, was but a piece of coarse gingerbread, tricked out
      with the Dutch metal of false sentiment. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      I WAS startled by the batho-romantic sentiment of Matthew, somewhat in the
      same manner as the young lady at the bookseller's, when she was accosted
      by a musical dustman, with&mdash;"I say, ma'am, do you happen to have the
      hair of 'All round my hat I vears a green villow?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      But, however ridiculous they may appear, such incongruous characters are
      by no means caricatures&mdash;nay, are "as plentiful as blackberries,"
      especially in the lower grades of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was indulging in a reverie of this sort, when Monsieur Dubois, my kind
      and gentlemanly tutor, abruptly entered the office. I felt proud in having
      obtained his friendship&mdash;for he was to me a mine of wealth, and
      appeared master of every subject upon which my curiosity prompted me to
      inquire, whilst the worthy Frenchman was so flattered by my sincere
      respect, that he took a delight in imparting his knowledge to so willing
      and diligent a scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crobble had promised that I should continue my studies, being much
      pleased with the proof I had been fortunate enough to give him of my
      progress, generously offering to defray the charges of tuition; and I
      found in my new place, even more time than when in the employ of Mr.
      Timmis: for, indeed, half-a-clerk would have been sufficient to have
      conducted the whole business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was no less surprised at the unusual abruptness of approach, than at the
      extraordinary excitement apparent in the manner of Monsieur Dubois; for he
      always boasted of his coolness and philosophy under all circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, peace!&mdash;'mon cher ami'&mdash;peace is proclaim"&mdash;cried
      he, raising his hat and his eyes to the dingy ceiling of our office&mdash;"Grace
      a Dieu!&mdash;le tyran Napoleon&mdash;le charlatan est renverse de son
      piedestal&mdash;oui, mon eleve&mdash;I vill see, again once more my dear
      France!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He grasped my hand in his ecstasy, and tears filled his eyes to
      overflowing. I had heard rumours of the restoration of the Bourbons, but I
      had not anticipated the loss of my inestimable tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was almost ashamed of my selfishness; but vanquished my feelings so far
      as to congratulate him on his prospects, with as much cordiality and
      appearance of truth as I could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust, however," said I, "that restored to your country, and your
      friends, you will find that happiness you so much deserve. Go where you
      will, you will be followed by the regrets of your English friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! les Anglais!&mdash;'combien'&mdash;how motch 'reconnaissance?'" said
      he, "I vill have for them! I sall them forget nevare!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crobble interrupted our colloquy. "All right t'other side the channel,
      Mounseer," cried be, elated; "we've licked Boney: he's done up; stocks are
      up; and Timmis, (your old master, Andrew) is as busy as a bee&mdash;only
      he's making money instead of honey!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands with Monsieur Dubois; and congratulated him upon the
      restoration of Louis the Eighteenth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned to him Monsieur Dubois' intention of proceeding immediately to
      France. "He's right," cried he; "let every man stick to his King and his
      country; and I say"&mdash;he suddenly checked himself, and beckoning me
      aside, continued in an under tone&mdash;"Andrew, you understand this
      Mounseer better than I do; he appears a good fellow in the main: if he
      should want a lift, to fit him out for the voyage, or any thing of that
      sort, tell him Corny Crobble will lend him a hand, for old acquaintance
      sake; I shan't stick at a matter of forty or fifty pound&mdash;you
      understand&mdash;put it to him, as a matter of business; for that'll suit
      his proud stomach best, perhaps"&mdash;then, turning to Monsieur, he said,
      "Excuse whispering before company, Mounseer Dubois. Good morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bon jour, Monsieur," replied Dubois, making my obese governor one of his
      most graceful bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was highly gratified at being selected as the medium of this generous
      offer; which Monsieur Dubois received without hesitation, as one who
      intended to repay it; but, at the same time, with the most grateful
      acknowledgments of Mr. Crobble's considerate kindness. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      "I REMEMBER, when I was a young man, I once took a fancy to rowing," said
      Mr. Crobble one day to me. "I wasn't then quite so round as I am at
      present. Cousin Tom and I hired a wherry, but somehow we found we didn't
      make much way. Tom was steering, and I took the sculls, sitting my back to
      him like a gaby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I, think there must be something wrong about your rowing,' said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My rowing!' cried I; 'nonsense!&mdash;it's because you don't steer
      right.' Well, at last a waterman came alongside, and grinning (the fellow
      couldn't help it) good-naturedly, pointed out the cause of our dilemma; at
      which we both laughed heartily. Ever since that time I've been of opinion,
      that unless people, 'who row in the same boat,' understand each other,
      they'll never get along&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at this lengthy prologue, not conceiving to what it could
      possibly lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Andrew," resumed he, "I mean to be very industrious, and devote
      a whole day to giving you an insight into the business; after which I
      expect you'll pull away, while I only steer, which will suit me to a T&mdash;,
      you understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, sir," I replied; and, in consequence, he really set about the
      task; and I soon acquired sufficient knowledge in the business, as not
      only to row in the same boat with him, but, what was still more agreeable
      to my patron's indolence, to manage the "craft" without his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months after the departure of Monsieur Dubois, he sent a remittance,
      with interest on the amount, advanced by Mr. Crobble, with a long epistle
      to me, stating, that he had entered into partnership with his elder
      brother, and commenced the business of a banker, under the firm of "Dubois
      Freres," at the same time informing me that they were already doing a
      large stroke of business, and wanted an agent in London, requesting me to
      inform him if it would be agreeable to Mr. Crobble for them to draw upon
      his respectable house.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw at once the advantages of this correspondence, and so warmly
      solicited Mr. Crobble to accede, that he at last consented, provided I
      undertook the whole management of the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English were now daily flocking to Paris, and the money required for
      their lavish expenditure in the gay capital of France compelled their
      application to the bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Dubois Freres had their share of this lucrative business, and, as
      their agents in London, we necessarily became participators in their large
      transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three months these operations had increased so enormously, and the
      profits were so considerable, that Mr. Crobble not only advanced my
      salary, but consented to engage the assistance of two junior clerks. I was
      now a man of some consideration. I was the senior clerk of the
      establishment, although the youngest of the three.
    </p>
    <p>
      In two years I found myself at the head of six clerks, and had as much
      business as I could possibly manage.
    </p>

      My star was in the ascendant. I had not only more money than I required
      for my expenses, but was enabled to maintain my poor old father, who daily
      became more and more infirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rented a small cottage at the rural village of Hackney, but my labour
      occupied me early and late, and it was only on a Sunday I could really
      enjoy my home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years after quitting the office of Mr. Timmis, I had the
      inexpressible pleasure of employing him to purchase stock for his errand
      boy! I was proud as a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said that boy would turn out well," said the good-natured Mr. Wallis;
      "he always had a good principle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now bids fair," said Mr. Timmis, "to have both principal and
      interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crobble having lately had a large property left him in Hertfordshire,
      rarely came to the office above once a-quarter, to settle accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good dividend&mdash;a very good dividend!" said he, upon receipt of the
      last quarter's profits. "But, Mr. Mullins, I cannot forget that this
      business is your child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm happy to say a thriving one," I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you satisfied&mdash;perfectly satisfied?" demanded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond my wishes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not," said he shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir?" exclaimed I, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Sir!" repeated he. "Those who sow should reap. I've no children&mdash;I'm
      an idle fellow&mdash;a drone, sir&mdash;and won't consent to consume all
      the honey. Don't speak, sir&mdash;read that!" and he pulled a parchment
      from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a deed of partnership between Cornelius Crobble, of Lodge,
      Hertfordshire, Esquire, and the poor cobbler's son,

      THE evening is calm&mdash;the sun has just sunk below the tiles of the
      house, which serenely bounds the view from the quiet attic where I wield
      the anserine plume for the delectation of the pensive public&mdash;all
      nature, etc.&mdash;the sky is deep blue, tinged with mellowest red, like a
      learned lady delicately rouged, and ready for a literary soiree&mdash;the
      sweet-voiced pot-boy has commenced his rounds with "early beer," and with
      leathern lungs, and a sovereign contempt for the enactments of the new
      police-act&mdash;greasy varlets proclaim to the hungry neighbourhood&mdash;"Baked
      sheeps' heads, hot!"&mdash;O! savoury morsel!&mdash;May no legislative
      measure ever silence this peripatetic purveyor to the poor! or prevent his
      calling&mdash;may the tag-rag and bob-tail never reject a sheep's head!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never sees a sheep's head, but I thinks on you," said Mrs. Spriggins,
      whose physiognomy was as yellow and as wrinkled as a duck's foot.
      Spriggins whipped his horse, for they were driving in a one-horse chaise,
      with two boys, and an infant in arms&mdash;Spriggins whipped his horse
      spitefully, for Mrs. S.'s sarcasm inspired him with a splenetic feeling;
      and as he durst not chastise her, the animal received the benefit of her
      impetus. Spriggins was a fool by nature, and selfish by disposition. Mrs.
      S. was a shrivelled shrew, with a "bit o' money;"&mdash;that was the bait
      at which he, like a hungry gudgeon, had seized, and he was hooked! The
      "spousals" had astonished the vulgar&mdash;the little nightingale of
      Twickenham would have only smiled; for has he not sweetly sung&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There swims no goose so grey, but soon or late <br /> She finds some
      honest gander for her mate;"
    </p>
    <p>
      and her union was a verification of this flowing couplet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At different times, what different meanings the self-same words obtain.
      According to the reading of the new poor-law guardians, "Union," as far as
      regards man and wife, is explained "Separation;" or, like a ship when in
      distress, the "Union" is reversed! In respect of his union, Spriggins
      would have most relished the reading of the former! But there are
      paradoxes&mdash;a species of verbal puzzle&mdash;which, in the course of
      this ride, our amiable family of the Spriggins's experienced to their
      great discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing up a turnpike-gate, Mrs. S. handed a ticket to the white-aproned
      official of the trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have gone home the way you came out&mdash;that ticket won't do
      here," said the man; "so out with your coppers&mdash;three-pence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I've got any half-pence!" said Mr. S., fumbling in his
      pennyless pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I must give you change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I'm afraid I hav'nt got any silver," replied Mr. S., with a long
      face.&mdash;"I say, mister, cou'dn't you trust me?&mdash;I'd be wery sure
      to bring it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man only winked, and, significantly pointing the thumb of his left
      hand over his sinister shoulder, backed the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, I'm blessed," exclaimed Mr. S.&mdash;and so he was&mdash;with a
      scolding wife and a squalling infant; "and they calls this here a trust,
      the fools! and there ain't no trust at all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the poor animal got another vindictive cut. Oh! Mr. Martin!&mdash;thou
      friend of quadrupeds!&mdash;would that thou had'st been there. "It's all
      my eye and Betty Martin!" muttered Mr. S., as he wheeled about the jaded
      beast he drove, and retraced the road. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      THE horse is really a noble animal&mdash;I hate all rail-roads, for
      putting his nose out of joint&mdash;puffing, blowing, smoking, jotting&mdash;always
      going in a straight line: if this mania should continue, we shall soon
      have the whole island ruled over like a copy-book&mdash;nothing but
      straight lines&mdash;and sloping lines through every county in the
      kingdom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me the green lanes and hills, when I'm inclined to diverge; and the
      smooth turnpike roads, when disposed to "go a-head."&mdash;"I can't bear a
      horse," cries Numps: now this feeling is not at all reciprocal, for every
      horse can bear a man. "I'm off to the Isle of Wight," says Numps: "Then
      you're going to Ryde at last," quoth I, "notwithstanding your hostility to
      horse-flesh." "Wrong!" replies he, "I'm going to Cowes." "Then you're
      merely a mills-and-water traveller, Numps!" The ninny! he does not know
      the delight of a canter in the green fields&mdash;except, indeed, the said
      canter be of the genus-homo, and a field preacher!
    </p>
    <p>
      My friend Rory's the boy for a horse; he and his bit o' blood are
      notorious at all the meetings. In fact I never saw him out of the saddle:
      he is a perfect living specimen of the fabled Centaur&mdash;full of
      anecdotes of fox-chases, and steeple-chases; he amuses me exceedingly. I
      last encountered him in a green lane near Hornsey, mounted on a roadster&mdash;his
      "bit o' blood" had been sent forward, and he was leisurely making his way
      to the appointed spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in Buckinghamshire last week," said he; "a fine turn out&mdash;such
      a field! I got an infernal topper tho'&mdash;smashed my best tile; tell
      you how it was. There was a high paling&mdash;put Spitfire to it, and she
      took it in fine style; but, as luck would have it, the gnarled arm of an
      old tree came whop against my head, and bonneted me completely! Thought I
      was brained&mdash;but we did it cleverly however&mdash;although, if ever I
      made a leap in the dark, that was one. I was at fault for a minute&mdash;but
      Spitfire was all alive, and had it all her own way: with some difficulty I
      got my nob out of the beaver-trap, and was in at the death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed heartily at his awkward dilemma, and wishing him plenty of
      sport, we parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Rory! he has suffered many a blow and many a fall in his time; but he
      is still indefatigable in the pursuit of his favourite pastime&mdash;so
      true is it&mdash;that
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pleasure we delight in physic's pain;"
    </p>
    <p>
      his days pass lightly, and all his years are leap years!
    </p>
    <p>
      He has lately inherited a considerable property, accumulated by a miserly
      uncle, and has most appropriately purchased an estate in one of the
      Ridings of Yorkshire!
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his love for field-sports, however, he is no better "the better,"
      says he, "is often the worse; and I've no notion of losing my acres in
      gambling; besides, my chief aim being to be considered a good horseman, I
      should be a consummate fool, if, by my own folly, I lost my seat!" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      THE sad only hate a joke. Now, my friend Rory is in no sense a sad fellow,
      and he loves a joke exceedingly. His anecdotes of the turf are all racy;
      nor do those of the field less deserve the meed of praise! Lord F____ was
      a dandy sportsman, and the butt of the regulars. He was described by Rory
      as a "walkingstick"&mdash;slender, but very "knobby"&mdash;with a pair of
      mustaches and an eye-glass. Having lost the scent, he rode one day slick
      into a gardener's ground, when his prad rammed his hind-legs into a brace
      of hand-glasses, and his fore-legs into a tulip-bed. The horticulturist
      and the haughty aristocrat&mdash;how different were their feelings&mdash;the
      cucumber coolness of the 'nil admirari' of the one was ludicrously
      contrasted with the indignation of the astonished cultivator of the soil.
      "Have you seen the hounds this way?" demanded Lord F____, deliberately
      viewing him through his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hounds!" bitterly repeated the gardener, clenching his fist. "Dogs, I
      mean," continued Lord F____; "you know what a pack of hounds are&mdash;don't
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what a puppy is," retorted the man; "and if so be you don't budge,
      I'll spile your sport. But, first and foremost, you must lug out for the
      damage you have done&mdash;you're a trespasser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a sportsman, fellow&mdash;what d'ye mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then sport the blunt," replied the gardener; and, closing his gates, took
      Lord F____ prisoner: nor did he set him free till he had reimbursed him
      for the mischief he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just; and however illegal were the means, I applauded them for
      the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend B___d, that incorrigible punster, said, "that his horse had put
      his foot in&mdash;and he had paid his footing,"
    </p>
    <p>
      B___d, by the bye, is a nonpareil; whether horses, guns, or dogs, he is
      always "at home:" and even in yachting, (as he truly boasts) he is never
      "at sea." Riding with him one day in an omnibus, I praised the convenience
      of the vehicle; "An excellent vehicle," said he, "for punning;"&mdash;which
      he presently proved, for a dowager having flopped into one of the seats,
      declared that she "never rid vithout fear in any of them omnibus things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is she talking about?" said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      "De omnibus rebus," replied he,&mdash;"truly she talks like the first lady
      of the land; but, as far as I can see, she possesses neither the carriage
      nor the manners!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you read the motto on the Conductor's button?" I demanded. "No;" he
      replied, "but I think nothing would be more appropriate to his calling
      than the monkish phrase&mdash;'pro omnibus curo!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture a jolt, followed by a crash, announced that we had lost a
      wheel. The Dowager shrieked. "We shall all be killed," cried she; "On'y to
      think of meeting vun's death in a common omnibus!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mors communis omnibus!" whispered B___d, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I had written thus far, when spit&mdash;spit&mdash;splutter&mdash;plop!&mdash;my
      end of candle slipped into the blacking bottle in which it was
      "sustained," and I was left to admire&mdash;the stars of night, and to
      observe that "Charles's wain was over the chimney;" so I threw down my pen&mdash;and,
      as the house was a-bed&mdash;and I am naturally of a "retiring"
      disposition, I sought my pallet&mdash;dreaming of literary fame!&mdash;although,
      in the matter of what might be in store for me, I was completely in the
      dark!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
